They are far below the Godhead, yet they dwell in an estate above that\nof fallen humans (Ps. 8:4-5). A.T. Pierson described the state of these beings:\nGod is the all-presiding, all-pervading, uncreated Spirit.\nBetween Him and man there lies an intermediate realm,\ninhabited by a higher order of intelligences, neither pure\nspirit like God, nor so physically constituted as man. They\nare called angels, because they appear in Scripture as mes-\nsengers of God to man.4\nMyer Pearlman explained the nature of angelic beings in this way:\nWith lightning speed and noiseless movement they pass\nfrom place to place. They inhabit the spaces of the air\n4 Arthur Tappan Pierson, The Bible and Spiritual Life (New York: Gospel Publishing House, 1908) 166.\n\nabove us. Some we know to be concerned with our welfare;\nothers are set on our harm. The inspired writers draw aside\nthe curtain and give us a glimpse of this invisible world, in\norder that we may be both encouraged and warned.5\nThe only authoritative source individuals have for the existence and\nactivities of angelic beings is the Holy Scripture. Therefore, Christians should\nlearn all that the Bible says about angels but not go beyond what is revealed.\nThe prominence of angels in God\u2019s providential administration is indicated\nby how frequently they are mentioned in the Bible. The Old Testament refers\nto them 108 times, while the New Testament mentions them 165 times.\nAngelology can be used to describe the study of holy angels as well as the\nstudy of Satan and demons. Satan was once a great angel, and Scripture\nimplies that demons are fallen angels. Whether they are holy or unholy,\nthe Bible uses the term angel to describe spirit-beings: \u201cAnd war broke out\nin heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon\nand his angels fought\u2026\u201d (Rev. 12:7). Angelic, satanic and demonic activity\nis mentioned throughout Scripture, yet is greatly misunderstood by many\nChristians. Consequently, this chapter will develop a biblically-based under-\nstanding of Angelology, Demonology (fallen angels) and Satanology (Satan).\nI. Angelology (Holy Angels)\nA. Definition\nThe word \u201cangel,\u201d whether derived from the Hebrew mal\u2019ak of the Old\nTestament or from the Greek angelos of the New Testament, means \u201cmessen-\nger.\u201d Holy angels are messengers of God, while fallen angels are messengers of\nSatan, \u201cthe god of this age\u201d (2 Cor. 4:4).\nB. The origin of angels\nAngels are created beings; they have not existed eternally. Scripture states\nthat God created the heavenly angelic hosts:\n5 Myer Pearlman, Knowing the Doctrines of the Bible (Springfield, MO: Gospel Publishing House, 1939) 79.\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of\nheavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The\nseas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of\nheaven worships You\u201d (Neh. 9:6).\n\u2022 \u201cPraise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! Praise Him,\nsun and moon; Praise Him, all you stars of light! Praise Him, you\nheavens of heavens, And you waters above the heavens! Let them\npraise the name of the Lord, For He commanded and they were\ncreated\u201d (Ps. 148:2-5).\n\u2022 \u201cFor by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are\non earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or\nprincipalities or powers. All things were created through Him and\nfor Him\u201d (Col. 1:16).\nAngels are among the \u201cinvisible\u201d things God created through Christ Jesus\n(Col. 1:16). Scripture is not explicit as to when they were created. They may\nhave been created on the first day of creation, immediately after the creation\nof the heavens. Genesis 1:1 says: \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens\nand the earth.\u201d Job 38:4-7 says that \u201cthe sons of God shouted for joy\u201d when\nGod laid the foundations of the earth. Therefore, they were present before\nthe earth was created.\nC. The nature of angels\n1. Angels are not corporeal\na) Angels are spirits. They do not have physical bodies like humans. The\npsalmist wrote, \u201cWho makes His angels spirits\u2026\u201d (Ps. 104:4). Hebrews\nstates, \u201cAre they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those\nwho will inherit salvation?\u201d (1:14). In Luke, Jesus said, \u201c\u2026a spirit does not\nhave flesh and bones as you see I have\u201d (24:37-39). Although angels are not\ncorporeal, they are still individual creatures, both finite and spatial. However,\nthey exist in a freer relation to time and space than humans. Many can be\npresent at one time in a very limited space. \u201cJesus asked him, saying, \u2018What is\n\nyour name?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Legion,\u2019 because many demons had entered him\u201d\n(Luke 8:30). They are not omnipresent. Each is only in one place at one time.\nb) Angels are not to be worshiped. Angels are invisible to human\nsight, and people are unconscious of their presence except on special occa-\nsions when God allows individuals to see them. Some suggest that they are\ninvisible because of the human tendency to worship them. Scripture warns\nagainst humans worshiping angels: \u201cLet no one cheat you of your reward,\ntaking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those\nthings which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind\u2026\u201d (Col.\n2:18). Humans are called to worship the Creator, not the creature (Rom.\n1:25). Angel worship is a practice of the Gnostic heresy that even the angels\nspoke against:\n\u2022 \u201cAnd I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, \u2018See that\nyou do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren\nwho have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony\nof Jesus is the spirit of prophecy\u2019\u201d (Rev. 19:10).\n\u2022 \u201cNow I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard\nand saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who\nshowed me these things. Then he said to me, \u2018See that you do not\ndo that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the\nprophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship\nGod\u2019\u201d (Rev. 22:8-9).\nc) Angels have, on numerous occasions, assumed the form of human\nbodies. \u201cDo not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have\nunwittingly entertained angels\u201d (Heb. 13:2). This verse clearly implies angels\nhave appeared and can regularly appear in the form of humans. Scripture\nenumerates many occasions when this became a reality:\n\u2022 \u201cNow the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was\nsitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet\nthem, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground\u201d\n(Gen. 19:1).\n\n\u2022 \u201cNow in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to\na city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man\nwhose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin\u2019s name\nwas Mary\u201d (Luke 1:26-27).\n\u2022 \u201cAnd she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the\nother at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain\u201d (John 20:12).\n\u2022 \u201cNow an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, \u201cArise and go\ntoward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem\nto Gaza\u201d (Acts 8:26).\n\u2022 \u201cNow behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone\nin the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up,\nsaying, \u2018Arise quickly!\u2019 And his chains fell off his hands. Then the\nangel said to him, \u2018Gird yourself and tie on your sandals\u2019; and so\nhe did. And he said to him, \u2018Put on your garment and follow me\u2019\u201d\n(Acts 12:7-8).\nd) Angel of the Lord is a unique expression. The phrase \u201cthe Angel of the\nLord\u201d is used throughout the Old Testament to represent special significance\nin relation to the presence of God. A careful study of Scripture seems to indi-\ncate that the Angel of the Lord is the second person of the Godhead, Christ\nHimself, in pre-incarnate presence. These encounters happened throughout\nthe Old Testament.\nThe Angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar as she was fleeing from the\nhouse of Abraham (Gen. 16:7-14). This passage uses the \u201cAngel of the Lord\u201d\nexpression four times. However, verse thirteen states: \u201cThen she called the\nname of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees; for she\nsaid, \u2018Have I also here seen Him who sees me?\u2019\u201d Hagar recognized this \u201cAngel\nof the Lord\u201d to be God.\nThe Angel of the Lord appeared to Abraham when he was about to slay\nhis son Isaac (Gen. 22:11-18). God had told Abraham to offer his son. When\n\nAbraham lifted up the knife to do so, \u201cBut the Angel of the Lord called to\nhim from heaven and said, \u2018Abraham, Abraham\u2026Do not lay your hand on\nthe lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you\nhave not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.\u2019\u201d By using the words\n\u201cfrom Me\u201d the Angel of the Lord is definitely speaking as God.\nHe appeared to Moses out of the bush that burned but was not con-\nsumed (Exod. 3:2-5). Verse two of this passage states, the \u201cAngel of the Lord\u201d\nappeared to Moses \u201cin a flame of fire from the midst of a bush.\u201d In verse four\nthis same person is called God: \u201cGod called to him from the midst of the\nbush and said, \u2018Moses, Moses!\u2019\u201d\nThe Angel of the Lord showed himself to Gideon as he was threshing\nwheat in the winepress, hiding it from the Midianites (Judg. 6:11-23). Verse\ntwelve states, \u201cthe Angel of the Lord\u201d appeared to Gideon. Verse fourteen\nrefers to this visitation as from the Lord: \u201cThen the Lord turned to him and\nsaid, \u2018Go in this might of yours\u2026\u2019\u201d\nIn Judges 13:2-23 Manoah and his wife (parents of Samson) are visited\nby one who is called \u201cthe Angel of the Lord,\u201d \u201cthe Angel of God\u201d and \u201cthe\nMan of God.\u201d Twelve times these expressions are used of this One, but verse\ntwenty-two states, \u201cAnd Manoah said to his wife, \u2018We shall surely die, because\nwe have seen God!\u2019\u201d\n2. Angels are a limited company, not a propagating race\nAll the angels were created at one time. They do not die, and they do not\npropagate; therefore, there is no increase or decrease in their numbers. Jesus\nmade it quite plain that they do not marry.\nJesus answered and said to them, \u201cThe sons of this age\nmarry and are given in marriage. But those who are\ncounted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection\nfrom the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;\nnor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels\n\nand are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection\u201d (Luke\n20: 34-36).\nAngels are referred to in the masculine gender, which is always used\nwhen there is no sexual distinction. Though Scripture includes references\nto the \u201csons of God,\u201d the Bible does not mention the \u201csons of angels\u201d (Luke\n20:34-36).\n3. Angels are vast in number\nMany scriptures speak of the great number of angels. Hebrews states,\n\u201cBut you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the\nheavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels\u201d (12:22). At His\narrest Jesus said, \u201cOr do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and\nHe will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?\u201d (Matt. 26:53).\nRevelation speaks of a mighty chorus of angels around the throne of God:\n\u201c\u2026and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thou-\nsands of thousands...\u201d (5:11). The main thought conveyed by these verses is\nthat within human comprehension, their number is innumerable. God, who\nknows all things, knows the number of angels.\nD. The abode of angels\nWhile angels are often depicted as ministering on God\u2019s behalf to indi-\nviduals on earth, their main abode is in heaven. \u201cAnd suddenly there was with\nthe angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: \u2018Glory\nto God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!\u2019 So it was,\nwhen the angels had gone away from them into heaven\u2026\u201d (Luke 2:13-15;\nsee also Matt. 22:30). Jesus told Nathanael \u201c\u2026you shall see heaven open, and\nthe angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man\u201d (John\n1:51). Jesus used the phrase \u201cangels in heaven\u201d (Mark 13:32) and Paul used\nthe words \u201cangel from heaven\u201d (Gal. 1:8). Scripture suggests that angels have\na special place to dwell in heaven. Jude addressed the issue of \u201c\u2026the angels\nwho did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode\u2026\u201d (Jude 6).\n\nE. The personality of angels\nAngels possess every feature of personality. They are individual beings.\nThey are rational beings: \u201c\u2026my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of the\nangel of God, to know everything that is in the earth\u201d (2 Sam.14:20). They\nare inquisitive: \u201cthings which angels desire to look into\u201d (1 Pet. 1:12). They\nrender intelligent worship: \u201cPraise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His\nhosts!\u201d (Ps. 148:2). They possess emotions: \u201cLikewise, I say to you, there is\njoy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents\u201d (Luke\n15:10). They are moral beings created with the ability to know and do right\nor wrong behavior. They have been rewarded for obedience and punished\nfor disobedience: \u201cFor if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast\nthem down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved\nfor judgment\u2026\u201d (2 Pet. 2:4). Jude also addresses this punishment: \u201cAnd the\nangels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He\nhas reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the\ngreat day\u2026\u201d (6). There was a time of probation when the angels could choose\nto obey or disobey God. Those who disobeyed were cast out of heaven, while\nthose who obeyed were confirmed in their stand for God. There is no scrip-\ntural record of any angels falling after the period of probation passed.\nF. The knowledge, wisdom and power of angels\nThe angels are represented in Scripture as having superior knowledge,\nwisdom and power to humans. \u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows, not\neven the angels of heaven, but My Father only\u201d (Matt. 24:36). This scripture\nimplies that angels know more than humans: \u201c\u2026my lord is wise, according\nto the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the\nearth\u201d (2 Sam. 14:20). The demons are presented in Scripture as often having\na better understanding of Christ\u2019s ministry: \u201cDid You come to destroy us? I\nknow who You are\u2014the Holy One of God!\u201d (Luke 4:34). Though the knowl-\nedge of angels is great, they are not omniscient (1 Pet. 1:12).\nThe Scripture says much concerning the power and strength of angels.\n\u201cBless the Lord, you His angels, Who excel in strength, who do His word,\nHeeding the voice of His word\u201d (Ps. 103:20). Angels are powerful but they\nare not omnipotent. Their strength is derived from God: \u201cThey are unable\nto do those things which are peculiar to Deity\u2013create, act without means, or\n\nsearch the human heart.\u201d6 God\u2019s holy angels are powerful but submitted to His\nwill: \u201c\u2026whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a\nreviling accusation against them before the Lord\u201d (2 Pet. 2:11). His angels are\nmighty: \u201c\u2026and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus\nis revealed from heaven with His mighty angels\u201d (2 Thess. 1:7). Disciples were\ndelivered from prison by God\u2019s powerful angels: \u201cBut at night an angel of the\nLord opened the prison doors and brought them out\u2026\u201d (Acts 5:19). \u201cNow\nbehold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and\nhe struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, \u2018Arise quickly!\u2019 And his\nchains fell off his hands\u201d (Acts 12:7). The stone placed in front of the Lord\u2019s\ntomb could have weighed four tons, yet the Scripture states: \u201cAnd behold, there\nwas a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and\ncame and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it\u201d (Matt. 28:2).\nIn Revelation 20:1-2, John writes: \u201cThen I saw an angel coming down from\nheaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. He\nlaid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and\nbound him for a thousand years\u2026\u201d The angels are subservient to Christ: \u201cwho\nhas gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and\npowers having been made subject to Him\u201d (1 Pet. 3:22). They are \u201cHis mighty\nangels\u201d (2 Thess. 1:7). Christ is the head over all holy angels \u201c\u2026and you are\ncomplete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power\u201d (Col. 2:10).\nG. The classifications, organization and variety of angels\n1. Good and evil angels\nAngels may be classified under two headings: good (holy angels) or evil\n(demons and Satan). We will address evil angels separately in the Demonology\nand Satanology sections.\n2. Different positions or offices\nComparing the following three verses, it seems there are five different\npositions or offices of authority among the angels: thrones, dominions,\n6 Lewis Sperry Chafer, Systematic Theology (Dallas, TX: Dallas Seminary Press, 1947) II, 15.\n\nprincipalities, authorities and powers. \u201c\u2026far above all principality and power\nand might and dominion\u2026\u201d (Eph. 1:21); \u201cFor by Him all things were cre-\nated that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether\nthrones or dominions or principalities or powers\u2026\u201d (Col. 1:16); \u201c\u2026angels\nand authorities and powers having been made subject to Him\u201d (1 Pet. 3:22).\nScripture does not clarify what each of these designations indicates. Heavenly\norganization is not easy for humans to comprehend.\nAll that we know is, that there is foundation for the main\nidea\u2013that there is no dull and sating uniformity among\nthe inhabitants of heaven\u2013that order and freedom are not\ninconsistent with gradation or rank\u2013that there is glory\nand a higher glory\u2013power and a nobler power\u2013rank and\na loftier rank, to be witnessed in the mighty scale. As\nthere are orbs of dazzling radiance amidst the paler and\nhumbler stars of the sky, so there are bright and majestic\nchieftains among the hosts of God, nearer God in posi-\ntion, and like God in majesty, possessing and reflecting\nmore of the Divine splendour, than their lustrous brethren\naround them.7\nAs we consider what these various ranks may signify, the most important\npoint is that Jesus, as the divine, eternal, son of God, is high above them all;\nHe has no equal and no superior (Heb. 1:7-14).\n3. Cherubim: Whether this term indicates a special position or an exalted\nservice rendered by those who bear this name is uncertain. Cherubim first\nappear at the entrance to the garden of Eden: \u201cSo He drove out the man;\nand He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden\u2026to guard the way\nto the tree of life\u201d (Gen. 3:24). Over the ark of the covenant, in the holy of\nholies of the tabernacle in the wilderness, two golden cherubim were crafted\nas part of the mercy seat (Exod. 37:6-9; 2 Kings. 19:15; Ps. 80:1; 99:1). They\nwere also woven into the beautiful inner veil of the tabernacle and temple\n7 John Eadie, Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House,\n1883) 102.\n\n(Exod. 26:1). Ezekiel refers to them nineteen different times. They are most\nlikely synonymous with the \u201cliving creatures\u201d of Revelation 4:6-5:14. These\nand other references demonstrate that cherubim are often associated with the\nrighteousness and the majesty of the Throne of God.\n4. Seraphim: The word seraphim means \u201cthe burning ones.\u201d They are\nmentioned only in Isaiah 6. They are seen by the prophet as standing above\nthe throne of God, each having six wings. They are occupied with praising\nGod, crying one to another, \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole\nearth is full of His glory!\u201d (v. 3). One of the seraphim responded to Isaiah\u2019s\nconfession of having unclean lips, flew with a live coal from off the altar,\ntouched the prophet\u2019s lips and said, \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; Your\niniquity is taken away, And your sin purged\u201d (vv. 6-7). In this way God pre-\npared Isaiah for his prophetic call. Most importantly, Seraphim continually\nworship God.\n5. Michael and Gabriel: These two are distinct among the angel hosts for\nthey are the only two whose names are mentioned. Michael is mentioned on\nfour different occasions in the Scripture: \u201cAt that time Michael shall stand\nup, The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people\u2026\u201d (Dan.\n12:1). The name Michael means \u201cwho is like God?\u201d He is spoken of as the\none who defends the people of Israel. \u201cBut the prince of the kingdom of\nPersia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief\nprinces, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of\nPersia\u201d (Dan. 10:13). Daniel 10:21 speaks of \u201cMichael your prince.\u201d If it\nis true that there are angelic personalities who oversee certain nations, such\nas the \u201cPrince of Persia\u201d and the \u201cPrince of Greece,\u201d then Michael could be\nthought of as the \u201cPrince of Israel\u201d (Dan. 10:21). Jude\u2019s epistle states, \u201cYet\nMichael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about\nthe body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but\nsaid, \u2018The Lord rebuke you!\u2019\u201d (Jude 9). Here, Michael is called an archangel.\nHe is the only one to whom the Bible applies this designation. If he is the\nonly one, then perhaps he will be the one to speak at the second coming of\nthe Lord: \u201cFor the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with\nthe voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God\u201d (1 Thess. 4:16).\nRevelation 12:7-9 addresses the warring capability of Michael:\n\nAnd war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels\nfought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels\nfought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for\nthem in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast\nout, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who\ndeceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his\nangels were cast out with him.\nGabriel, signifying \u201cthe mighty one,\u201d is never designated in the Bible\nas an archangel. He is mentioned four times in the Scripture and always as\nthe bearer of great tidings concerning God\u2019s purposes. In Daniel 8:15-27, he\ninformed Daniel of events concerning the end times. In Daniel 9:20-27, he\nrevealed to Daniel the meaning of the seventy weeks vision. When Zacharias,\nthe father of John the Baptist, was burning incense in his priestly role, Gabriel\nappeared to him and said to him, \u201cDo not be afraid, Zacharias, for your\nprayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall\ncall his name John\u2026I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and\nwas sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings\u201d (Luke 1:13, 19).\nGabriel\u2019s preeminent position is indicated by the words, \u201cwho stands in the\npresence of God.\u201d John was to be the forerunner of the Lord\u2019s coming and the\none who would baptize Him in the Jordan. Gabriel\u2019s greatest message was his\nannouncement to Mary that she would conceive and give birth to Jesus: \u201cHe\nwill be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will\ngive Him the throne of His father David\u2026and of His kingdom there will be\nno end\u201d (Luke 1:32-38).\nH. The ministry of angels\n1. Angels in relation to God\na) Angels worship and praise God: The principal and possibly most\nimportant ministry of angels is that of worshiping and offering unceasing\npraise to God, for He is worthy:\n\u2022 \u201cThen I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the\nthrone, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them\n\nwas ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,\nsaying with a loud voice: \u2018Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To\nreceive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and\nglory and blessing!\u2019\u201d (Rev. 5:11-12).\n\u2022 \u201cBut when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says:\n\u2018Let all the angels of God worship Him\u2019\u201d (Heb. 1:6).\n\u2022 \u201cAnd one cried to another and said: \u2018Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of\nhosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!\u2019\u201d (Isa. 6:3).\n\u2022 \u201cBless the Lord, you His angels, Who excel in strength, who do His\nword, Heeding the voice of His word. Bless the Lord, all you His\nhosts, You ministers of His, who do His pleasure\u201d (Ps. 103:20-21).\nAngels do not draw attention to themselves but ascribe glory to God.\nAngels were present at creation and joined together in worship: \u201cWhere were\nyou when I laid the foundations of the earth?\u2026When the morning stars sang\ntogether, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?\u201d (Job 38:4-7).\nb) Angels brought God\u2019s law to His people: \u201c\u2026who have received the\nlaw by the direction of angels and have not kept it\u201d (Acts 7:53). Paul wrote\nthat the law \u201c\u2026was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator\u201d\n(Gal. 3:19). Hebrews states: \u201c\u2026the word spoken through angels proved\nsteadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward\u201d\n(Heb. 2:2).\nc) Angels execute God\u2019s judgments upon His enemies: \u201cThen immedi-\nately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God.\nAnd he was eaten by worms and died\u201d (Acts 12:23). When the Assyrian army\nsurrounded the city of Jerusalem, \u201c\u2026it came to pass on a certain night that\nthe angel of the Lord went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one\nhundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morn-\ning, there were the corpses\u2014all dead\u201d (2 Kings 19:35).\n\nd) Angels will gather together God\u2019s elect at Christ\u2019s second coming:\n\u201c\u2026and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with\npower and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a\ntrumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from\none end of heaven to the other\u201d (Matt. 24:30-31). Angels will stand before\nthe gates of the New Jerusalem that will have \u201c\u2026a great and high wall with\ntwelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates\u2026\u201d (Rev. 21:12). Thiessen suggests\nthat \u201c\u2026they will apparently serve as a kind of honorary body of sentinels,\nas if to guarantee that nothing that is unclean or defiled will ever enter that\ncity.\u201d8\ne) Angels will assist in administering God\u2019s judgment in the last days: \u201cLet\nboth grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to\nthe reapers, \u2018First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn\nthem, but gather the wheat into my barn\u2026 The enemy who sowed them is the\ndevil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels\u201d (Matt.\n13:30, 39). God\u2019s angels will be the reapers who will separate the believers from\nthe unbelievers. They know the difference between the wheat and the tares.\n\u201cSo it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the\nwicked from among the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will\nbe wailing and gnashing of teeth\u201d (Matt. 13:49-50). The Scripture states that\nJesus will be \u201c\u2026revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire\ntaking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not\nobey the gospel or our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Thess. 1:7-8). Between Revelation\n7 and Revelation 20, angels are mentioned 57 times as having a part in God\u2019s\njudgment. They are portrayed as pouring out the bowls of wrath in Revelation\n16: \u201cThen I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, \u2018Go\nand pour out the bowls of the wrath of God on the earth\u2019\u201d (v. 1). God will use\nthe multitude of mighty angels to help bring all people to judgment.\n2. Angels in relation to Christ\nAngels have shown and continue to show a great interest in the person\nand ministry of Jesus Christ. The fact that Paul includes angels in what seems\n8 Henry Clarence Thiessen, Introductory Lectures in Systematic Theology (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans\nPublishing Company, 1949) 207.\n\nto be an early Christian hymn demonstrates the profound importance of the\nrole of angels in the ministry of Jesus: \u201cAnd without controversy great is the\nmystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit,\nSeen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world,\nReceived up in glory\u201d (1 Tim. 3:16). There are at least fifteen distinct refer-\nences concerning angels\u2019 involvement in the ministry of Jesus Christ:\n\u2022 The birth of Jesus\u2019 forerunner, John the Baptist, was announced to\nJohn\u2019s father by an angel (Luke 1:11-13).\n\u2022 Mary was informed by the angel Gabriel that she would be the\nmother of Jesus (Luke 1:26-38).\n\u2022 Joseph was assured by an angel to \u201c\u2026not be afraid to take to you\nMary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy\nSpirit\u201d (Matt 1:20).\n\u2022 Angels brought tidings of Jesus\u2019 birth to shepherds in the fields at\nBethlehem (Luke 2:8-15).\n\u2022 Joseph was warned by an angel to \u201ctake the young Child and His\nmother\u201d to Egypt to escape Herod (Matt 2:13).\n\u2022 Joseph, again directed by an angel, was instructed to return to the\nland of Israel after the death of Herod (Matt. 2:19-20).\n\u2022 Angels ministered to Jesus after His wilderness temptation (Matt.\n4:11).\n\u2022 Jesus told Nathanael that he would see angels ascending and\ndescending upon Himself (John 1:51).\n\u2022 An angel from Heaven strengthened Jesus in the garden of\nGethsemane (Luke 22:43).\n\n\u2022 Jesus said He had the authority to ask the Father, and He would\nsend more than twelve legions of angels to protect Him if necessary\n(Matt. 26:53).\n\u2022 An angel \u201crolled back the stone from the door\u201d and spoke to the\nwomen who came to Jesus\u2019 empty tomb (Matt. 28:2-7).\n\u2022 Angels were present at Christ\u2019s ascension (Acts 1:11).\n\u2022 In Jesus\u2019 glorified position, angels have \u201cbeen made subject to Him\u201d\n(1 Pet. 3:22).\n\u2022 Angels will accompany Jesus when He comes the second time\n(Matt. 16:27; 25:31).\n3. Angels in relation to believers\nBelievers should clearly understand the ministry of angels on their behalf,\nso that their faith might be encouraged regarding this gracious provision from\nGod. Some commentators believe the ministry of angels to humans ceased\nat the ascension of Christ and will not resume until His return to earth.\nThis argument is difficult to justify in light of Hebrews 1:14: \u201cAre they not\nall ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salva-\ntion?\u201d The context of these words clearly implies angels are still ministering\ntoday. The following are some of the many ministries angels have performed\non behalf of God\u2019s people in the Old and New Testament. This work most\nassuredly continues.\na) Angels protect and guard humans from harm: \u201cFor He shall give His\nangels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall\nbear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone\u201d (Ps. 91:11-12). Jesus\nreferenced this angelic care when He warned against harming children: \u201cTake\nheed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in\nheaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven\u201d (Matt.\n18:10). Angels were instrumental in delivering Lot from disaster and harm.\n\nWhen the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry,\nsaying, \u201cArise, take your wife and your two daughters who\nare here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the\ncity.\u201d And while he lingered, the men took hold of his\nhand, his wife\u2019s hand, and the hands of his two daughters,\nthe Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out\nand set him outside the city (Gen. 19:15-16).\nb) Angels deliver humans from their enemies: \u201cThe angel of the Lord\nencamps all around those who fear Him, And delivers them\u201d (Ps. 34:7).\nElisha and his servant experienced this blessing of deliverance:\nAnd when the servant of the man of God arose early and\nwent out, there was an army, surrounding the city with\nhorses and chariots. And his servant said to him, \u201cAlas, my\nmaster! What shall we do?\u201d So he answered, \u201cDo not fear,\nfor those who are with us are more than those who are with\nthem.\u201d And Elisha prayed, and said, \u201cLord, I pray, open\nhis eyes that he may see.\u201d Then the Lord opened the eyes\nof the young man, and he saw. And behold, the moun-\ntain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha\n(2 Kings 6:15-17).\nDaniel spoke of angelic protection to king Darius: \u201cMy God sent His\nangel and shut the lions\u2019 mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was\nfound innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before\nyou\u201d (Dan. 6:22). Peter attributed his deliverance to the help of an angel:\n\u201cNow I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel, and has delivered\nme from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish peo-\nple\u201d (Acts 12:11).\nc) Angels encourage individuals in extreme trials: When Elijah was fleeing\nfrom the threats of Jezebel \u201c\u2026he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold,\nthen an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat\u201d (1 Kings 19:5).\nJacob was encouraged while fleeing from the wrath of his brother Esau:\n\nThen he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the\nearth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels\nof God were ascending and descending on it. And behold,\nthe Lord stood above it and said: \u201cI am the Lord God of\nAbraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on\nwhich you lie I will give to you and your descendants\u201d\n(Gen. 28:12-13).\nTwenty years later, as Jacob was returning to meet his brother Esau, he\nwas filled with fear in anticipation of the reception he might receive from\nEsau. The Scripture states a host of angels met him, no doubt to greatly\nencourage him: \u201cSo Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\nWhen Jacob saw them, he said, \u2018This is God\u2019s camp.\u2019 And he called the name\nof that place Mahanaim [meaning two hosts, or two bands]\u201d (Gen. 32:1-2).\nPaul, in the midst of a storm at sea that threatened the lives of all on board,\ncheered his fellow sailors with these words:\nAnd now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss\nof life among you, but only of the ship. For there stood by\nme this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and\nwhom I serve, saying, \u201cDo not be afraid, Paul; you must\nbe brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted\nyou all those who sail with you\u201d (Acts 27:22-24).\nd) Angels grant wisdom and guidance: Joseph was perplexed when he\nlearned that Mary was pregnant and he resolved to divorce her secretly (Matt.\n1:18-19). \u201cBut while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the\nLord appeared to him in a dream, saying, \u2018Joseph, son of David, do not be\nafraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her\nis of the Holy Spirit\u2019\u201d (Matt. 1:20; see also Matt. 2:13,19-20). Philip was\ndirected to lead an Ethiopian eunuch to the Lord: \u201cNow an angel of the\nLord spoke to Philip, saying, \u2018Arise and go toward the south along the road\nwhich goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza\u2019\u201d (Acts 8:26). The Roman centu-\nrion, Cornelius, was praying and \u201c\u2026saw clearly in a vision an angel of God\ncoming in and saying to him, \u2018Cornelius!\u2026Your prayers and your alms have\n\ncome up for a memorial before God. Now send men to Joppa, and send for\nSimon whose surname is Peter\u2019\u201d (Acts 10:3-5).\ne) Angels escort the soul at death: \u201cSo it was that the beggar died, and was\ncarried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was\nburied\u201d (Luke 16:22). Many Christians have testified in regards to near death\nexperiences that at the moment of their departure from this life, they were\nconscious of the presence of heavenly beings around them.\nf) Angels rejoice in the salvation of humans: \u201cLikewise, I say to you, there\nis joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents\u201d (Luke\n15:10). The fact that angels rejoice in the repentance of each sinner demon-\nstrates the vital interest angels have in believers. No doubt angels also rejoice\nas Jesus confesses in their presence the faith of new believers: \u201cAlso I say to\nyou, whoever confesses Me before men, him the Son of Man also will confess\nbefore the angels of God\u201d (Luke 12:8).\ng) Angels learn from the church: Though they are extremely wise, they\nare not omniscient. Therefore, it is likely that they are continually learning,\nespecially with regard to God. For ages the angels have been worshiping and\npraising God for His holiness and the greatness of His power in creation.\nThrough the gospel, God has revealed a whole new sphere of His greatness,\ncharacter, infinite love and marvelous grace. The angels desire to know more\nof this marvelous salvation:\nOf this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched\ncarefully, who prophesied of the grace that would come to\nyou, searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of\nChrist who was in them was indicating when He testified\nbeforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would\nfollow. To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but\nto us they were ministering the things which now have been\nreported to you through those who have preached the gospel\nto you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven\u2014things which\nangels desire to look into (1 Pet. 1:10-12).\n\nFurthermore, God\u2019s dealings with the church have provided a revelation\nto the angels of His manifold wisdom: \u201c\u2026to the intent that now the mani-\nfold wisdom of God might be made known by [or through] the church to the\nprincipalities and powers in the heavenly places\u201d (Eph. 3:10). The angels will\nassuredly enjoy the prospects revealed in Ephesians 2:7 \u201c\u2026that in the ages\nto come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness\ntoward us in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nh) Welcoming the ministry of angels: We are not to pray to angels or\nto request their help. Their ministry is directed on our behalf by the Lord\nHimself. Therefore, to experience the benefits and blessings of these \u201cminis-\ntering spirits,\u201d believers must keep close to God. The great promise of Psalm\n91 that \u201c\u2026He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your\nways\u201d (v. 11), is given to those who dwell \u201cin the secret place of the Most\nHigh,\u201d and \u201cabide under the shadow of the Almighty\u201d (v. 1). Followers are\ninstructed by God\u2019s promise that \u201cThe angel of the Lord encamps all around\nthose who fear Him, And delivers them\u201d (Ps. 34:7). Remember the angels\nare \u201c\u2026ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit\nsalvation\u2026\u201d (Heb. 1:14).\nII. Demonology (Evil Angels)\nThe knowledge that God\u2019s great guardian angels watch over and minister\nto the redeemed children of the Lord should inspire and encourage every\nbeliever. However, believers must also recognize in this area of spiritual war-\nfare the vast host of enemy spirits whose purposes are to thwart all spiritual\nprogress. The subject of demonology occupies a substantial place in the rev-\nelations of Scripture. Demon comes from the Greek words daimonion and\ndaimon, which are sometimes translated \u201cdevil\u201d or \u201cdevils,\u201d but which are\nmore accurately translated \u201cdemon\u201d or \u201cdemons.\u201d There is only one devil\n(diabolos), but there are multitudes of demons. One of the fundamental tac-\ntics of warfare is to study the enemy. We would be unwise if we did not study\nthe enemy in the area of spiritual conflict. With this idea in mind, we shall\ncarefully study the subject of demonology (evil angels).\n\nA. The classification of demons\nSome differentiate between evil (fallen) angels and demons; however, the\nmajority of Bible scholars believe evil angels are demons. We recognize the\nBible is not explicit with regard to this point. Even so, we believe the scrip-\ntural evidence best supports that demons are evil (fallen) angels. The Bible\ncontrasts demons with those angels who have continued to do the will of\nGod: \u201cAnd the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their\nown abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judg-\nment of the great day\u2026\u201d (Jude 6). Peter wrote \u201c\u2026God did not spare the\nangels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains\nof darkness, to be reserved for judgment\u201d (2 Peter 2:4). Angels are depicted\nin service to the fallen angel, Satan: \u201c\u2026Depart from Me, you cursed, into the\neverlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels\u201d (Matt. 25:41). Revelation\nalso supports the idea that demons are evil angels that were cast out from\nheaven along with the devil: \u201cAnd war broke out in heaven: Michael and his\nangels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought\u2026and\nhis angels were cast out with him\u201d (Rev. 12:7-9).\nB. The reality of demons\nJesus recognized the reality of demons. He announced that He cast out\ndemons by the Holy Spirit: \u201cAnd if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom\ndo your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I\ncast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come\nupon you\u201d (Matt. 12:27-28). He commissioned His disciples to do the same:\n\u201cHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you\nhave received, freely give\u201d (Matt. 10:8). Jesus proclaimed, \u201c\u2026these signs will\nfollow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will\nspeak with new tongues\u201d (Mark 16:17). The disciples Jesus commissioned\nalso believed in the reality of demons: \u201cThen the seventy returned with joy,\nsaying, \u2018Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name\u2019\u201d (Luke 10:17).\nThe apostle Paul recognized the reality of demons: \u201cRather, that the\nthings which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God,\nand I do not want you to have fellowship with demons\u201d (1 Cor. 10:20).\n\nPaul believed people could be deceived by demonic activity: \u201cNow the Spirit\nexpressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed\nto deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons\u2026\u201d (1 Tim. 4:1).\nC. The origin of demons\nGod did not create demons sinful. God created all things, and Scripture\nclearly states, \u201c\u2026God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it\nwas very good\u201d (Gen. 1:31). If demons were once angels \u201c\u2026who did not keep\ntheir proper domain, but left their own abode\u2026\u201d (Jude 6), and \u201cGod did not\nspare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell\u2026\u201d (2 Pet. 2:4), then\nwe can assume they were once perfect, sinless beings. The cause of their fall\nand the nature of how they became demons has been the subject of much\nconjecture. We will address the issues with the greatest scriptural support.\nAs mentioned previously, we believe the scriptural evidence best supports\nthat demons are evil (fallen) angels. The view that demons are fallen angels\ncomes from the fact that a number of scriptures refer to a great host of spirits\nwho are variously designated as under the authority of Satan: \u201cBeelzebub,\nthe ruler of the demons\u201d (Matt. 12:24), \u201cthe devil and his angels\u201d (Matt.\n25:41) and \u201cthe dragon and his angels\u201d (Rev. 12:7-9). These spirit beings\nwere not created evil by God but must have fallen from their created, per-\nfect condition, possibly at the time of Lucifer\u2019s revolt. Keeping with the fact\nthat Satan in his unfallen position was called \u201cthe star of the morning\u201d (Isa.\n14:12, NASB), many believe that no fewer than one third of the angels fol-\nlowed in Lucifer\u2019s fall and now are the demon hosts (Rev. 12:4). Some of\nthe angels who \u201cdid not keep their proper domain\u201d (Jude 6), have been \u201ccast\ndown to hell [Tartarus]\u201d and are kept in \u201cchains of darkness, to be reserved\nfor judgment\u201d (2 Pet. 2:4). The reason some fallen angels are bound while\nothers are free to cooperate with Satan in his opposition to God is not made\nclear in Scripture. Some have tried to answer this question theorizing that\ndemons are a separate class of angelic beings: either the offspring of angels\nand antediluvian (pre-flood) women (Gen. 6:1-4) or the disembodied spirits\nof the inhabitants of a pre-Adamic earth. These theories simply do not have\nscriptural support.\n\nIn examining the entire subject of the origin of demons, we must avoid\nconjecture and stay within the revelation of Scripture. God has not chosen to\nclearly reveal detailed explanations concerning the origin of demons. Regardless,\nthe fact that the Bible makes their existence very clear is sufficient reason for us\nto examine their evil nature, design and methods, as well as to formulate our\ndefense against them. Let us concentrate on what we know about them while\nnot giving them more prominence than their positions merit.\nD. The nature of demons\nMany observations about the nature of good angels are true of demons\nin that demons appear to be fallen angels. Demons are spirit personalities\nand are incorporeal. It would seem they desire to indwell humans and if not\npermitted will even choose to enter swine (Matt. 8:31).\n1. The strength of demons\nDemons are strong. They are no match for Jesus, but they are stronger\nthan humans.\nAnd when He had come out of the boat, immediately\nthere met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean\nspirit, who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no\none could bind him, not even with chains, because he had\noften been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains\nhad been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in\npieces; neither could anyone tame him (Mark 5:2-4).\n2. The knowledge of demons\nThough demons are far from omniscient, at times their awareness is cun-\nning and shrewd. They know much concerning the authority and deity of\nChrist and of their own eternal doom. When confronted by Jesus, demons\n\u201ccried out, saying \u2018What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God?\n\nHave You come here to torment us before the time?\u2019\u201d (Matt. 8:29). Demons\noften instantly recognized and called out the authority of Jesus:\nThen they went into Capernaum, and immediately on\nthe Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught\u2026Now\nthere was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit.\nAnd he cried out, saying, \u201cLet us alone! What have we to\ndo with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy\nus? I know who You are\u2014the Holy One of God!\u201d (Mark\n1:21-24).\nAfter Christ\u2019s ascension demons were still able to recognize the authority\nof Jesus: \u201cAnd the evil spirit answered and said, \u2018Jesus I know, and Paul I\nknow; but who are you?\u2019\u201d (Acts 19:15). James addressed demonic knowledge\nwhen he wrote, \u201cYou believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the\ndemons believe\u2014and tremble!\u201d (James 2:19).\n3. The character of demons\nDemons are wicked, unclean and vicious: \u201cWhen He had come to\nthe other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two\ndemon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that\nno one could pass that way\u201d (Matt. 8:28). The Scripture refers to demons as\n\u201cunclean spirits\u201d: \u201cAnd when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He\ngave them power over unclean spirits\u2026\u201d (Matt 10:1).\nThere even seems to be degrees of wickedness among demons:\n\u201cWhen an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes\nthrough dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he\nsays, \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 And\nwhen he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.\nThen he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more\nwicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and\n\nthe last state of that man is worse than the first\u201d (Matt.\n12:43-45).\nE. The purpose of demons\nThe overall purpose of demons seems to be twofold: they seek to hinder\nthe purposes of God and to extend the power of Satan. Satan\u2019s desire to rule\nand to be \u201clike the Most High\u201d has not changed from its initial expression\nin Isaiah 14:13-14. His wilderness temptation of Jesus is evidence of this\nunchanging, arrogant spirit as he even sought to influence Christ to worship\nhim (Matt. 4:9). Under Satan\u2019s control, the hosts of demons are interested in\nfostering this very plan.\nF. The activities of demons\n1. Demons oppose believers\nDemons constantly oppose Christians and their endeavors to live godly\nlives and to serve the Lord. \u201cFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,\nbut against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of\nthis age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\u201d (Eph.\n6:12). Through demons, Satan opposes the work of the church: \u201cTherefore\nwe wanted to come to you\u2014even I, Paul, time and again\u2014but Satan hin-\ndered us\u201d (1 Thess. 2:18). Since Satan is not omnipresent, many of his activ-\nities must be carried out by demons.\n2. Demons encourage false doctrine and induce believers to depart from\nthe faith\nPaul warned Timothy that demons encourage false doctrines such\nas asceticism:\nNow the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will\ndepart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and\n\ndoctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having\ntheir own conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding\nto marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which\nGod created to be received with thanksgiving by those\nwho believe and know the truth (1 Tim. 4:1-3).\n3. Demons are behind all idol worship\nWhat am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what\nis offered to idols is anything? Rather, that the things\nwhich the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and\nnot to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with\ndemons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the\ncup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord\u2019s table and\nof the table of demons (1 Cor. 10:19-21).\nDiscussing the question of eating meat offered to idols, Paul said \u201c\u2026we\nknow that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but\none\u201d (1 Cor. 8:4). However, he warned the church that demons are behind\nthe worship of idols. If the Corinthian Christians ate meat offered to idols,\nthey were in danger of having fellowship with demons. If demons were not\nbehind the worship of idols, it would be difficult to understand why people\nfind spiritual satisfaction in bowing down and pledging allegiance to objects\nmade by human hands. But in reality, demon spirits and demonic spiritual\ncommunion are behind idol worship that deceives the multitudes. Revelation\n9:20 points out this association between demons and idolatry: \u201cBut the rest\nof mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the\nworks of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold,\nsilver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.\u201d\n4. Demons can cause various physical afflictions\nDemons have the power to cause human ailments, such as muteness\n(Matt. 9:32-33), blindness (Matt. 12:22), irrational behavior (Luke 8:26-35),\ndeformities, defects (Luke 13:11-17) and convulsions (Mark 9:18-22).\n\n5. Demons are sometimes used by God to accomplish His purposes\nUnger explained that God sometimes even uses demons to carry out His\nsovereign plan:\nDemons are the instruments for executing God\u2019s plans\nfor punishing the ungodly (Ps. 78:49). Wicked Ahab was\npunished for his crimes by a \u201clying spirit\u201d which Jehovah\nput in the mouth of all his prophets to lead them to disas-\nter at Ramoth Gilead (1 Kings 22:23). Demons lure the\nGod-resisting armies of Armageddon to similar catastro-\nphe (Rev. 16:13-16). Satan and his ministers also effect\nGod\u2019s plans for chastening the godly. Satan\u2019s sifting but\naccomplished the Lord\u2019s winnowing, as in the case of\nPeter (Luke 22:31). Job is brought through Satanic testing\nto a place of spiritual enlargement and refinement (Job\n42:5-6). The incestuous believer at Corinth is delivered\n\u201cunto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit\nmight be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus\u201d (1 Cor. 5:5).\nHymenaeus and Alexander are \u201cdelivered unto Satan, that\nthey may be taught not to blaspheme\u201d (1 Tim. 1:20).9\nDemons do not serve God. However, God is still able to sovereignly carry\nout His purposes in all situations. Paul mentioned that since humans \u201c\u2026did\nnot see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do\nwhat ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteous-\nness, evil, covetousness, malice\u201d (Rom. 1:28-29, ESV). Sometimes God has\ncarried out His discipline and wrath on rebellious people through handing\nthem over to the demonic activity of Satan.\n9 Unger, 70.\n\nG. Demon possession\n1. The reality of demon possession\nAlthough many in the modern world do not believe in the concept of\ndemon possession, the Bible teaches that humans have been and can be pos-\nsessed by demons.\na) Demon possession and the ministry of Jesus\nJesus ministered to the demon-possessed people who confronted Him\nor who were brought to Him, by casting out their demons. \u201cWhen evening\nhad come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He\ncast out the spirits with a word\u2026\u201d (Matt. 8:16). Jesus freed a tormented man\npossessed by a legion of demons, who wandered among the tombs, naked,\nin shackles and chains: \u201cAnd when He had come out of the boat, immedi-\nately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit\u2026Then\nthe unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two\nthousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and\ndrowned in the sea\u201d (Mark 5:2-13). The people brought to Jesus, \u201c\u2026a man,\nmute and demon-possessed. And when the demon was cast out, the mute\nspoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, \u2018It was never seen like this in\nIsrael!\u2019\u201d (Matt. 9:32-33).\nJesus used the casting out of demons as proof of His divine mission.\nWhen the Pharisees accused Him of casting out demons by Beelzebub, the\nprince of demons, Jesus showed them the foolishness of such a claim: \u201cIf\nSatan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his king-\ndom stand? And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons\ncast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out demons\nby the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you\u201d (Matt.\n12:26-28). Jesus believed that demons were real and that He was casting them\nout of possessed individuals. He even warned those who criticized Him for\nthis work that they were bordering on an unpardonable sin.\n\nb) Demon possession and the ministry of the early church\nJesus\u2019 commission to the apostles also testifies to the reality of demon\npossession: \u201cAnd He said to them, \u2018Go into all the world and preach the gos-\npel to every creature\u2026And these signs will follow those who believe: In My\nname they will cast out demons\u2026\u201d (Mark 16:15-17).\n(1) The early apostles cast out demons: \u201cAlso a multitude gathered from\nthe surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were\ntormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed\u201d (Acts 5:16).\n(2) Philip the evangelist freed those who were possessed: \u201cAnd the multi-\ntudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing\nthe miracles which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came\nout of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame\nwere healed\u201d (Acts 8:6-7).\n(3) The apostle Paul commanded demons to come out of people:\nNow it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain\nslave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who\nbrought her masters much profit by fortune-telling. This\ngirl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, \u201cThese\nmen are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim\nto us the way of salvation.\u201d And this she did for many\ndays. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the\nspirit, \u201cI command you in the name of Jesus Christ to\ncome out of her.\u201d And he came out that very hour (Acts\n16:16-18).\n(4) Demonic encounters were common in the early church. The dra-\nmatic events recorded in Acts 19:13-16 clearly evidence the reality of demon\npossession. Seven professional traveling exorcists tried to copy Paul by using\nthe name of Jesus to cast out demons. They suffered at the hands of the pos-\nsessed man, departing naked and wounded.\n\nc) Demon possession and the redeeming work of Christ\nDemonic activity seemed to increase during the life and ministry of Jesus\non earth. This might have happened because of Satan\u2019s opposition to the\nSeed of the woman (Gen. 3:15). John succinctly summarized the reason for\ndemonic opposition against Jesus: \u201cFor this purpose the Son of God was\nmanifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil\u201d (1 John 3:8). There\nwill be a similar increase in demonic activity in the world at the close of this\nage and into the great tribulation: \u201cNow the Spirit expressly says that in latter\ntimes some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and\ndoctrines of demons\u2026\u201d (1 Tim. 4:1).\nd) Demon possession contrasted with demon influence\nNot all demon activity results in demon possession. There is a vast differ-\nence between demon possession and demon influence. In demon possession,\ndemons enter, dominate and in some manner control the human body. In\ndemon influence, demons carry out warfare, from without, through sugges-\ntion, temptation and confusion. External demonic harassment or warfare is\nwhat Paul was most likely referring to when he mentioned \u201cthe fiery darts of\nthe wicked one\u201d (Eph. 6:16).\ne) Demon possession and sickness\nThe Scripture is clear that sickness, though originally the result of sin\nand Satan, is not usually an indication that someone is possessed. The Bible\nrepeatedly distinguishes between sickness and demon possession both in\ncause and in method of deliverance. Although some sickness is caused by\ndemonic possession, Scripture predominantly deals with sickness and demon\npossession in two separate categories. Thus the practice of some, who in min-\nistering to the sick always try to cast out a demon, is not biblical procedure.\nIn Jesus\u2019 ministry: \u201c\u2026He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who\nwere sick\u2026\u201d (Matt. 8:16). Jesus made this distinction of two categories in\nHis message to Herod, \u201cAnd He said to them, \u2018Go, tell that fox, \u201cBehold, I\ncast out demons and perform cures\u2026\u2019\u2019\u2019\u201d (Luke 13:32). Jesus laid hands on\nthe sick but rebuked the demons: \u201cWhen the sun was setting, all those who\n\nhad any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He\nlaid His hands on every one of them and healed them. And demons also came\nout of many, crying out and saying, \u2018You are the Christ, the Son of God!\u2019 And\nHe, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak\u2026\u201d (Luke 4:40-41). Again,\nthe distinction between healing and demon possession is clear in His com-\nmissioning of the disciples: \u201cThen He called His twelve disciples together and\ngave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases\u201d (Luke\n9:1). Demons are expelled; diseases are healed. There is a difference between\nhealing and exorcism.\n2. Demon possession today\nThe Bible does not say that demonic activity will cease after the New Testa-\nment era. Therefore, we should assume the devil is as active today as he was\nin biblical times. Dr. John C. Nevius, a Presbyterian missionary to China\nfrom 1854 to 1892, made a careful study of demon phenomena in Shantung\nProvince and presented evidence of widespread demon possession in modern\nChina. Unger refers to the findings of Dr. Nevius in the following paragraph:\nWhat is striking in the accounts given by Dr. Nevius is\ntheir close correspondence with the cases of demon pos-\nsession as recorded in the New Testament. For example,\nthe subject at the time of possession passes into an abnor-\nmal state (cf. Mark 9:18). During the transition he is fre-\nquently thrown into a violent paroxysm, falling senseless\non the ground or foaming at the mouth (cf. Mark 9:18;\nLuke 9:39-42). During the attack he evidences another\npersonality, his normal personality for the time being\nwholly or partially dormant (cf. Mark 5:7). The new per-\nsonality presents traits of character utterly foreign to those\ncharacteristic of the demonized in his normal condition,\nand this change of character is practically always in the\ndirection of moral impurity (cf. Luke 8:27). Many peo-\nple while being demon possessed display a superhuman\nknowledge. Frequently they appear to know the Lord Jesus\nas a divine person and show a fear of him (cf. Luke 8:31).\n\nThey sometimes converse in foreign languages, of which\nin their normal condition they are totally ignorant.10\nMissionaries throughout the world have expressed similar testimonies.\nSome ask why demonic manifestations are not seen more often in the\nUnited States. It appears that demons are wise and able to adapt to their\ncultural environment in both the age and places they abide. It seems in some\ncommunities and cultures they do not reveal the grosser aspects of their man-\nifestations. A demon is able to not only reveal himself as a \u201croaring lion\u201d\n(1 Peter 5:8) but also as \u201can angel of light\u201d (2 Cor. 11:14). In other words,\ndemons deceptively manifest themselves in different cultural contexts. Their\npresence may be unsuspected by many, but their purpose in opposing God\ncan be accomplished even in people who externally appear to be living moral\nor exemplary lives. Consequently, even highly educated individuals, who\nappear to oppose God\u2019s word with sophisticated rationalism, can also be used\nas tools for demonic activity. Many times only the spiritual gift of \u201cdiscerning\nof spirits\u201d (1 Cor. 12:10) can detect the presence of demons in the life of a\nseemingly well-adjusted individual.\n3. Casting out demons\nChristians should have a clear understanding of how to deliver those who\nare demon possessed. To address the topic of casting out demons, we will\ndraw heavily from an excellent chapter in Pentecostal Doctrine (edited and\npublished in England by Rev. Percy Brewster) written by George Canty, an\nevangelist in the Elim Pentecostal Church.11\na) Demons are cast out as part of the gospel commission\nThe casting out of demons will accompany the proclamation of the\ngospel: \u201cHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons\u201d\n10 Dr. John C. Nevius, Demon Possession and Allied Themes, 5th edition, 9-94, as quoted in Unger, 87.\n11 George Canty in Pentecostal Doctrine, ed., Rev. Percy Brewster (Cheltenham, England: Grenehurst Publish-\ners, 1976) 252-257.\n\nT \u2022h e Doctrine of Angels \u2022 Chapter Nine 499\n(Matt. 10:8; see also Mark 16:15-20; Luke 9:1-2; 10:1-17). George Canty\nwrote, \u201cJesus insists that casting out demons is part of the gospel commis-\nsion\u2026\u201d12 Although the casting out of demons is not mentioned in the gospel\nof John or the apostolic letters, Canty pointed out that these writings still\n\u201cfrequently urge the preaching of the gospel as a continuation of Christ\u2019s own\nwork. He was \u2018manifested to destroy the works of the devil\u2019 (1 John 3:8), and\n\u2018went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil\u2019 (Acts\n10:38)\u2026\u201d13 The casting out of demons is an essential part of gospel ministry.\nb) Signs of demonic possession\nTo cast out demons, Christians should develop discernment concerning\ndemonic activity. Canty observed the importance of Christians recognizing\nthe signs of demonic possession:\nThis work, in recent years, has been called for by the\nincreased interest in the occult, spiritism, Satanism and\nexperiments in magic. The effects upon people have been\ntypical. People become aware of \u201cpresences\u201d near them in\nan unpleasant sense, with unnerving apparitions, night-\nmares, supernatural hauntings, voices, impulses that can-\nnot be refused, depressions, tendencies to suicide, constant\nfear, inner urges to commit violence or murder, fits, unen-\ndurable tensions, sexual obsessions, hysteria, and so on.\nSheer madness or death can be the ultimate result. That\nthere is a call to care for those who are in this distressed\nstate is obvious, and there should be a special alertness to\ndiscern such needs.14\nAlthough not every act of evil is a sign of demonic possession, believ-\ners must prayerfully discern demonic influence in various individuals\nand situations.\n12 Canty, 252.\n13 Ibid.\n14 Ibid., 253.\n\nc) Demons are cast out in the name of Jesus\nThe Bible does not provide detailed instructions on how to cast out\ndemons. However, there are biblical examples in how Christ and the apostles\ncast out demons that should serve as a guide for our conduct. The Scripture\ndemonstrates that the primary method for casting out demons is in the name\nof Jesus. There is power in Jesus\u2019 name. Canty observed that the Bible has\nmultiple examples of demons being cast out in the name of Jesus:\nThe name of Jesus is the primary secret\u2026Christ\u2019s great\ncommission said, \u201cIn my name shall they cast out devils\u201d\n(Mark 16:17). Paul rebuked a spirit in the words: \u201cI com-\nmand thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her\u201d\n(Acts 16:18), just as Peter, when healing the lame man,\nsaid, \u201cIn the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and\nwalk\u201d (Acts 3:6, cf. 3:16; 4:10).15\nAlthough demons are cast out in Jesus\u2019 name, Canty warned it is danger-\nous for people to use Jesus\u2019 name as a magical formula in a manner similar\nto the sons of Sceva (Acts 19:11-20). Canty wrote, \u201cThe vital element is not\nthe formula, but the presence of Jesus in the life of the person casting demons\nout. He himself should be a true representative of Christ, a person \u2018in Christ,\u2019\naccepting the Lord\u2019s authority.\u201d16 In other words, to cast out demons in Jesus\u2019\nname is to walk in the authority of Jesus, not just proclaim the name of Jesus.\nCanty ultimately believed that a Christian\u2019s authority to cast out demons goes\nfar beyond words:\nIn that case, the formula is not perhaps so important. The\npronunciation of the name over the possessed person was\npartly a testimony to those who observed what was hap-\npening. The sons of Israel cast out spirits by various names,\nso, when the lame man was healed, the authorities at once\n15 Ibid.\n16 Ibid.\n\nT \u2022h e Doctrine of Angels \u2022 Chapter Nine 501\nwere curious as to which name was used (Acts 4:7). The\nfact is that demons left people when the name of Jesus was\nnot uttered (Acts 5:15-16; 19:11-12). Peter raised Dorcas\nfrom the dead without mentioning Jesus (Acts 9:40), just\nas Paul brought blindness on Elymas the sorcerer with-\nout invoking the name (Acts 13:9-11), and in the same\nway healed the cripple at Lystra (Acts 14:9-10). Christ\nhas given us a certain \u201cpower of attorney,\u201d to act in His\nbehalf, or \u201cin His name,\u201d without necessarily quoting the\nname constantly. Indeed we are told, \u201cWhatsoever ye do,\nin word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giv-\ning thanks to God and the Father by him.\u201d Obviously, this\ndoes not mean that we must be constantly repeating His\nname for every act. We act for Him, on His behalf\u2014\u201cYe\nserve the Lord Christ.\u201d17\nThe work of the cross has given every Christian authority to cast out\ndemons. Canty suggested that when Christians understand their authority in\nChrist, they confront demonic powers in less formulaic ways:\nThe casting out of demons does not require a barrage of\nwords with voluminous repetitions of the word \u201cJesus\u201d or\n\u201cChrist.\u201d We have authority, and can use it, as \u201cambas-\nsadors\u201d (2 Cor. 5:20), but we must avoid treating it as a\n\u201cmagic\u201d incantation, like a piece of abracadabra or spell.\nWhen we utter \u201cLord Jesus Christ\u201d it indicates that he is\nthe Lord of the one who speaks, otherwise we are like the\nsons of Sceva, unknown to the spirits.18\n17 Ibid., 253-254.\n18 Ibid., 254.\n\nd) Practices for casting out demons with limited or no biblical support\n(1) Casting out demons through the laying on of hands\nThere are no examples in Scripture of individuals laying hands on the\npossessed to cast out demons. Although the Bible has examples of people\nbeing healed (Luke 4:40), gifted for ministry (1 Tim. 4:14), blessed (Mark\n10:16) or baptized with the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17) through the laying on of\nhands, there is no scriptural record of demons being cast out in this manner.\n(2) Casting out demons by name\nThere is one example in Scripture of Jesus asking demons for their name\n(Mark 5:9). In this encounter, the demons responded that, \u201cMy name is Legion;\nfor we are many.\u201d Some have used this story to suggest that individuals must\nknow the name of demons or cast out demons by name to be effective. This\ndoes not seem necessary as demons are not spoken to by name in the Bible in\nany other instance where they are cast out. Most likely, in the story of Legion,\nJesus made the demons reveal their name to demonstrate His power and to\nhelp the people understand why a herd of swine were about to drown in the\nsea (Mark 5:13). Canty also suggested there is another problem with asking\ndemons their names; \u201cOne wonders what is the use if the spirits are lying spir-\nits? They could lie about their identities for the sake of putting us off.\u201d19\n(3) Conversing with demons\nJesus spoke with demons. Some use Jesus\u2019 example as reason to also\nconverse with the demonic realm. Canty warned that Christians should not\nengage in conversing with demonic forces:\nNor are we given any encouragement to hold conversa-\ntions with demons. Once they are known to be there, they\nshould be told to leave. Jesus \u201csuffered not the devils to\n19 Ibid.\n\nspeak, because they know Him\u201d and He charged unclean\nspirits \u201cthat they should not make him known\u201d (Mark\n1:34; 3:11-12). Certainly, spirits suffer from egotism\nand nothing pleases them better than to be the center\nof interest.20\n(4) Casting out demons through manifestations\nJust as demonic possession can have drastic effects on the human body,\nso can the casting out of demons. For instance, in the story of the boy with\na mute spirit, the Bible speaks of a demon that caused a boy to go mute\nand foam at the mouth (Luke 9:17-18, 20). When Jesus cast out the demon\nfrom the boy, \u201c\u2026the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out\nof him. And he became as one dead, so that many said, \u2018He is dead.\u2019 But\nJesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose\u201d (Luke 9:26-\n27). Some mistakenly believe certain demonic expressions such as convul-\nsions and foaming at the mouth need to be present when a demon is cast\nout. Others even believe that there must be signs of demons being physically\nexpelled through the body when they are cast out of an individual. However,\nthere are no examples in Scripture of individuals coughing up or spitting up\ndemons. More importantly, it is the authority of Jesus that frees individuals\nfrom demonic possession, not external manifestation.\ne) The ministry of casting out demons is available to all believers\nThe Bible states the ministry of casting out demons is for all believers.\nCanty wrote, \u201cIn this connection, nobody was ever given a special gift for\n\u2018exorcism,\u2019 only for discernment, as part of the protection of the Church,\nchiefly against false teachers with lying and deceitful doctrines of demons.\u201d21\nIn other words, no one is called to engage in ministry that deals with demons\nonly. Canty observed that any ministry that exclusively dealt with demons\n\u201c\u2026would draw attention more to Satan than to Christ. Preoccupation with\nthis sphere of things is a kind of tribute to the power of Satan.\u201d22 The casting\n20 Ibid., 254-255.\n21 Ibid., 255.\n22 Ibid.\n\nout of demons accompanies the proclamation of the gospel. However, the\ngood news of Jesus should be the ultimate focus of every believer.\nf) The role of repentance and faith in the ministry of casting out demons\nTo find true freedom, individuals need more than their demons cast out;\nthey need to truly repent and accept Jesus as their Savior. Canty spoke of\nsome of the deep spiritual issues that must be addressed along with freeing\nindividuals from demonic possession:\nThey need deeper help, in fact. Life situations, strong\ntemptations, affecting the willingness of a person to give\nup their sin, cannot be ignored. Unless sin is forsaken,\nthen, as Jesus said, the last state of that man may be worse\nthan the first, for the devil will return with several more.\nIt is the will of a man which makes a way in for the devil,\nand therefore repentance is required as well as exorcism.\nPatient pastoral interest may have to be taken to get down\nto the roots of a man\u2019s trouble, of which demon possession\nis not the cause but the result or symptom. It is wrong to\nassume that a particular evil in a man\u2019s life is the result of\ndemon control. It is more likely that the evil was there\nfirst, permitting the entry of Satanic power.23\nMost importantly, we must be mindful that the goal of ministry is not\nthe casting out of demons but the proclamation of the good news of Jesus.\nWhen the gospel is advanced, demons will manifest themselves. There is\ntransformative power when people repent of their sins and surrender to Jesus.\nWhen individuals become new creations in Christ, demons will flee. Canty\nstated this truth well:\nThe preaching of the gospel is deliverance \u2014 it is the power\nof God in itself \u201cunto salvation\u201d (deliverance). It could well\nbe that great conversions are sometimes straightforward\n23 Ibid.\n\ncases of the Word of God overcoming Satan in a man\u2019s life.\nIt would be absurd to think of a great conversion of a man\nleaving him with demons still in his heart. Can a man be\nsaved through faith in the gospel and then need a second\nexperience to save him from Satan? From what was he saved\nin the first instance? \u201cThe anointing breaks the yoke.\u201d24\nIn our pursuit to free individuals from the power of Satan, let us always\nbe mindful to first and foremost proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ.\ng) False notions of demonic possession\nWhen conducting deliverance ministry, discernment is essential. Some\npsychological disorders lead individuals into confusion about their spiritual\nwellbeing. Canty pointed out that for the highly suggestible or psychologi-\ncally troubled: \u201cWhere there is a ministry to the demon-troubled, it automat-\nically suggests to some that they also have such a condition. Their very fear\nof it can bring on pseudo-symptoms, especially if they are told that they may\nbe possessed.\u201d25 In instances such as this, ministers should help individuals\nfind the appropriate mental health support, pray for their healing and clearly\nassure them that they are not demon possessed.\n4. The occult and demon possession\nThe \u201coccult\u201d means \u201chidden things,\u201d and particularly deals with magic,\nfortune-telling and spiritism. According to Michael Green, Rector of St.\nAldate\u2019s, Oxford: \u201cMagic is the attempt to bring the spirit world under one\u2019s\nknowledge and control. It is the precise opposite of religion, which seeks\nsurrender to the divine, not control over it, and operates by faith not knowl-\nedge.\u201d26 Further, occult practices are an endeavor to \u201cconjure up spirits of the\nuniverse that are alien to God Almighty.\u201d27 The occult employs such methods\n24 Ibid.\n25 Ibid., 256.\n26 Michael Green, I Believe in Satan\u2019s Downfall (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm.

Fortune-telling uses palmistry, tarot cards, crystal gazing, psy-\nchometry (the practice of gaining knowledge through holding objects) and\nastrology. Spiritism, falsely called \u201cspiritualism\u201d and identical with ancient\nnecromancy, centers on individuals attempting to communicate with the\nspirits of the dead.\nAll of these practices are severely condemned in the Bible: \u201cGive no\nregard to mediums and familiar spirits; do not seek after them, to be defiled\nby them\u2026\u201d (Lev. 19:31). God opposes those who engage in such behavior:\n\u201cAnd the person who turns to mediums and familiar spirits, to prostitute\nhimself with them, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from\nhis people\u201d (Lev. 20:6). The Bible states that there is no life in consulting the\ndead: \u201cAnd when they say to you, \u2018Seek those who are mediums and wizards,\nwho whisper and mutter,\u2019 should not a people seek their God? Should they\nseek the dead on behalf of the living?\u201d (Isa. 8:19). The occult is an abomina-\ntion to God:\nThere shall not be found among you anyone who makes\nhis son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who\npractices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who inter-\nprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or\na medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. For\nall who do these things are an abomination to the Lord,\nand because of these abominations the Lord your God\ndrives them out from before you (Deut. 18:10-12).\nBelievers are warned against having anything to do with all such prac-\ntices, even though some of them appear outwardly to be quite innocent.\nAlthough there is much trickery in the occult, individuals must also realize\nthat demon spirits will attempt to deceive and enslave those who give them-\nselves to such practices. For instance, \u201cfamiliar spirits\u201d are most likely demons\nwho are familiar with a person and able to impersonate departed friends or\nloved ones in the unholy atmosphere of a s\u00e9ance. It is not by accident that\nsorcery and immorality are often mentioned in the same verses: \u201cNow the\nworks of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness,\n\nlewdness, idolatry, sorcery\u2026\u201d Revelation states, \u201cAnd they did not repent\nof their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts\u201d\n(9:21). Spiritism is so evil that it was a capital offence in Israel: \u201cYou shall not\npermit a sorceress to live\u201d (Exod. 22:18).\n5. The Christian and demon possession\nScholars have spoken and written much about the possibility of\nChristians becoming demon possessed. While individuals should not be\nignorant of Satan\u2019s devices (2 Cor. 2:11) or blind to the presence and power\nof demonic forces in the world, believers must not underestimate the pow-\nerful salvation and deliverance God has provided for every person in Christ\nJesus. All believers must ever encourage and strengthen themselves in the fact\nthat Christ \u201cdisarmed principalities and powers\u201d and \u201cmade a public specta-\ncle of them, triumphing over them in it\u201d (Col. 2:15). Christ is stronger than\nevery demonic power. Jesus is the stronger one mentioned in Luke 11:21-22:\n\u201cWhen a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in\npeace. But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him,\nhe takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.\u201d\nWhen the Lord called Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, He sent\nhim to both Jew and Gentile, \u201cto open their eyes, in order to turn them from\ndarkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God\u2026\u201d (Acts 26:18). Paul\ndescribed the effect of the gospel: \u201cHe has delivered us from the power of\ndarkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love\u201d (Col.\n1:13). John said that if a man has been born of God, \u201cthe wicked one does\nnot touch him (1 John 5:18). Jesus said, \u201cBehold, I give you the authority to\ntrample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and\nnothing shall by any means hurt you\u201d (Luke 10:19).\nPaul asked: \u201cAnd what accord has Christ with Belial?\u2026And what agree-\nment has the temple of God with idols?\u201d (2 Cor. 6:15-16a). Then he assured\nthe church: \u201cFor you are the temple of the living God\u2026\u201d (v. 16b). Paul stated\nthat the believer is God\u2019s temple. Therefore, God will not allow anyone who is\nHis, in whom He dwells, to be occupied by demons of Satan. The Christian\u2019s\nbody is \u201cthe temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19). A demon\n\nand the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in the same house. God will not allow\nit! Christ has provided a great deliverance for us from demonic possession.\nIn cases where Scripture mentions sicknesses were caused by demons (Matt.\n4:24; 9:32-33; 10:1; Mark 1:32; 3:15; Luke 6:17-18; 9:1), there is no indica-\ntion these individuals were in right relation with God.\nAlthough Christians cannot be demon possessed, this does not mean\nthat the children of God are totally immune to Satan\u2019s power. Believers have\ndeliverance from demonic influence as long as they live in Christ\u2019s victory\nover Satan. Christians live in Christ\u2019s victory by faith and obedience. When\nJesus told Peter, \u201c\u2026Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat,\u201d\nHe did not pray that Peter would not be allowed to be sifted, but that Peter\u2019s\nfaith would not fail (Luke 22:31-32). Disobedience and persistent wayward-\nness provide the enemy grounds from which he can attack and influence\nChristians. Scripture admonishes believers, \u201cdo not give the devil a foothold\u201d\n(Eph. 4:27, NIV). Ananias and Sapphira are solemn examples of those who\npermitted Satan to fill their hearts and \u201cto lie to the Holy Spirit\u201d (Acts 5:3).\nJesus is fully acquainted with the constant wrestling in which Christians\nare engaged, and He has provided the necessary armor for the constant victory\nof all believers (Eph. 6:12-18). Notably, the armor is of God\u2019s provision, and\nbelievers are admonished to \u201ctake\u201d the armor, not to \u201cmake\u201d it. The Scripture\ndoes not indicate that these spiritual conflicts which Christians have with the\nenemy are the result of demon possession. Rather, Satan and his cohorts are\nexternal foes who dwell in the atmosphere around believers (Eph. 2:2) and\nlook for opportunities to attack them.\nThe different uses of the word \u201cspirit\u201d in the Bible have led some to\nwrongly interpret and misunderstand its meaning. A statement adopted\nby the General Presbytery of the Assemblies of God accurately addressed\nthis confusion:\nSome, for example, teach that since the Bible speaks of\na spirit of cowardly fear, any deliverance from fear must\nbe by the casting out of an evil spirit or demon of fear.\nBut an examination of the same passage (2 Timothy 1:7)\n\nshows it speaks also of a spirit of power, of love, and of a\nsound mind or self-control. If people interpret fear to be\nan evil spirit needing to be cast out, to be consistent they\nwould need to beseech three good spirits to come in. The\nfallacy of this reasoning is obvious. Love and self-control\nare fruits of the Holy Spirit in our lives. By a spirit of love\nand of self-control is meant the attitudes that result from\nour cooperation with the Holy Spirit. Actually, the word\n\u201cspirit\u201d in many cases means an attitude or a disposition.\nDavid spoke of a broken spirit (Psalm 51:17); Solomon of\na humble spirit (Proverbs 16:19); Paul wanted to come to\nCorinth, not with a rod, but with love and a meek or gen-\ntle spirit (1 Corinthians 4:21). Peter spoke of the adorning\nof the heart with the imperishable gift of a meek and quiet\nspirit (1 Peter 3:4), actually meaning a quiet disposition.\nThis is in line with the frequent use of the word \u201cspirit\u201d\nfor one\u2019s own spirit and its expressions (Haggai 1:14; Acts\n17:16; 1 Corinthians 2:11, etc.). Thus, unless the context\nshows that an independent spirit-being is meant, it seems\nbest to take most phrases such as a haughty spirit, a hasty\nspirit, a spirit of slumber, a spirit of jealousy, etc., to be\nsins of the disposition or lusts of the flesh (Galatians 6),\nand not demons. A serious danger in considering all these\nsins of the disposition to be demons is that the individual\nmay feel no responsibility for the actions and feel that the\nnecessity for repentance is removed. Actually, the Bible\ncalls men to repent of these things and to put off these\nattitudes. The great conflict within us is not between the\nHoly Spirit and demons, but between the indwelling Holy\nSpirit and the flesh (that is, all the sensory apparatus that\ntends toward sin).28\nIn concluding this Demonology section, let it be noted that demons thrive\non publicity. Like their leader Satan, they are proud and selfish and seem to\n28Taken from a pamphlet published by the Gospel Publishing House, Springfield, MO, called \u201cCan Born-\nAgain Believers Be Demon Possessed?\u201d This is the statement approved as the official statement of the Assemblies\nof God by the General Presbytery in May, 1972 (see pp.9-10).\n\ndelight in receiving attention. The wise servant of God will not publicize the\nactivity of demons or seek to instill fear in the hearts of Christians concerning\nthem. There is no need for the children of God, who are walking in the light\nof His word, rejoicing in His victory over Satan and believing in His promises\nof triumph over evil, to fear demons. Demons are spirits of darkness, and\nbelievers are children of light. There is not enough darkness in the world to\nput out even the smallest expression of the light of Christ. Let us \u201c\u2026walk in\nthe light as He is in the light\u2026\u201d (1 John 1:7). There are almost three hun-\ndred references to angels in the Scripture and only approximately eighty to\ndevils and demons. In other words, there are more than three times as many\nreferences to angels in the Bible than there are to demons. Unfortunately,\nsome people spend three times as much time talking about demons as they do\nabout angels. Angels are our friends. Let us think and talk about them rather\nthan our enemies the demons. Demons are unclean and impure, not wor-\nthy of our primary focus. Paul admonished us: \u201cFinally, brethren, whatever\nthings are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever\nthings are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report,\nif there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy\u2014meditate on these\nthings\u201d (Phil. 4:8).\nIII. Satanology\nA. Importance of Satanology\nThough believers should never give Satan undue prominence, they should\nrealize the important place Satan has in Scripture. Except for the Father, Son\nand Holy Spirit, no other being is given more attention in the Bible, from\nbeginning to end, as Satan (the devil). Of no one else are we so minutely\ninformed concerning his origin, fall, character, work, influence, future judg-\nment and ultimate destiny. We can be deeply thankful for the Scripture\u2019s\nrevelation concerning Satan and his host of demons. Many individuals and\ncultures have been enveloped in oppressive darkness, wicked superstitions\nand harmful practices because they have lacked clear, biblical teaching con-\ncerning Satan. We need not be \u201cignorant of his devices\u201d (2 Cor. 2:11).\n\nB. The reality of Satan\u2019s existence\n1. Scriptural record of Satan\u2019s existence\nSatan is specifically mentioned or addressed on five occasions in the\nOld Testament. Although not mentioned by name, Satan is first revealed in\nScripture in the guise of the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve and caused\nthe first sin on earth (Gen. 3:1-15; see Rev. 12:9; 20:2). The first appear-\nance in the Bible of the Hebrew word for Satan is in 1 Chronicles 21:1:\n\u201cNow Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.\u201d He\nappears next on two occasions in the story of Job and his trials \u201c\u2026when the\nsons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also\namong them\u201d (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7). The final place Satan is mentioned in the\nOld Testament is in Zechariah 3:1-2:\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing\nbefore the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his\nright hand to oppose him. And the Lord said to Satan,\n\u201cThe Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen\nJerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from\nthe fire?\u201d\nIn the New Testament \u201cSatan\u201d or the \u201cdevil\u201d is mentioned about 72\ntimes. The apparent discrepancy between the number of times Satan is\nmentioned in the Old and the New Testaments can probably be accounted\nfor by Genesis 3:15: \u201cAnd I will put enmity Between you and the woman,\nAnd between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you\nshall bruise His heel.\u201d When Christ, the \u201cSeed\u201d of the woman, was born\nof the flesh and came to accomplish His great victory over Satan, the man-\nifest activity of the devil increased. The New Testament also mentions\nthe devil more frequently to most assuredly testify of Christ\u2019s power over\nSatan: \u201cFor this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might\ndestroy the works of the devil\u201d (1 John 3:8).\n\n2. The problem with a metaphorical Satan\nSome speak of Satan as a mere figure of speech, a metaphorical person-\nification of evil or even a delusion of an unsound mind. Interestingly, these\nerrant views of Satan are most found in lands where the name of Christ is most\nknown. When Satan\u2019s presence is denied, he is enabled to more subtly work in\ndeceiving humanity and disarming those he oppresses. The Scripture speaks of\nSatan as a real being with a real presence and agenda in the world. Chafer wrote\nof the biblical problem of viewing Satan as merely a spiritual concept or idea:\nIt may be observed that figures of speech are not created\nangels who sin and serve in realms of darkness and are\ndoomed to a final and dreadful judgment at the hand of\nGod. A metaphor would hardly enter a herd of swine and\nprecipitate their instant destruction. Nor would a meta-\nphor offer the kingdoms of this world to the Lord of glory,\nasserting that those kingdoms were delivered unto it and\nthat it gave them to whomsoever it would.29\nC. Satan\u2019s personality\nThe Bible speaks of the personality of Satan as fully as any other person\nin Scripture. Indeed, Scripture speaks of the personality of Satan in the same\nmanner it speaks of the personality of the Lord Jesus. To reject the personality\nof Satan, one would have to reject the authority of Scripture. Scripture uses\nthe characteristics of personality to describe Satan. He is constantly referred\nto as a personal being. The Bible uses personal pronouns when referring to\nSatan (Job 1:8, 12; 2:2-3, 6; Zech. 3:2; Matt. 4:10; John 8:44). Scripture\nascribes personal attributes to Satan: will (Isa. 14:13-14), knowledge (Job\n1:9-10) and personal activity (Job 1:9-11; Matt. 4:1-11; John 8:44; 1 John\n3:8; Jude 9; Rev. 12:7-10).\nD. Satan\u2019s origin\nMuch of the scriptural teaching regarding Satan\u2019s origin is covered in\n\u201cChapter Four: The Doctrine of Sin / Harmartiology\u201d and should be studied\n29 Chafer, II, 34.\n\nalong with this section. As noted previously in the Angelology section, Satan\nand the other angels were created by God: \u201cPraise Him, all His angels; Praise\nHim, all His hosts\u2026Let them praise the name of the Lord, for He com-\nmanded and they were created\u201d (Ps. 148:2-5).\nGod did not create the devil as we know him today. Everything God\nmade was good (Gen 1:31). Ezekiel 28:12-19 gives a detailed picture of\nSatan\u2019s original beauty and wisdom. This passage speaks of him as: \u201cFull of\nwisdom and perfect in beauty\u2026Every precious stone was your covering\u2026\nYou were the anointed cherub who covers\u2026You were perfect in your ways\nfrom the day you were created.\u201d Isaiah 14:12-17 gives us Satan\u2019s name before\nhe fell. He was called \u201cLucifer,\u201d which means \u201cthe morning star\u201d or literally\n\u201clight-bearer.\u201d He is pictured to us as a powerful angel of God\u2019s creation.\nThe mystery is how such a wise and beautiful being could have fallen to such\ndepths as to now be the vilest being in the universe.\nIsaiah 14 tells of Satan\u2019s fall and the reason for it. The devil\u2019s fall began\nwhen Lucifer lifted his will above that of God almighty: \u201c\u2026I will ascend into\nheaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the\nmount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend\nabove the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High\u201d (vv. 13-14).\nHeaven had been Heaven because only God reigned and none thought to\noppose His will. Therefore, harmony and peace prevailed. Then came the\nmoment of rebellion, and five times this beautiful, anointed cherub voiced\nhis will in opposition to God. Chafer said: \u201cFeeble indeed is the power of the\nhuman imagination to picture the crisis in this universe at the moment when\nthe first repudiation of God took place in heaven.\u201d30 What caused such an\nunthinkable happening? Pride and selfish ambition.\nPaul, when writing to Timothy concerning the qualifications for officers\nin the early church, insisted that such a person must not be a novice, \u201c\u2026lest\nbeing puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil\u201d\n(1 Tim. 3:6). Lucifer, in his selfish pride, sought to rise above the sphere in\nwhich he was created, above the purpose and service assigned to him. As a\n30 Chafer, II, 47.\n\nresult of his rebellion, Lucifer was cast out of the heavenly realm and the\noffice he held: \u201cYet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths\nof the Pit\u201d (Isa. 14:15). Therefore, the prophet Isaiah cried out, \u201cHow you are\nfallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How you are cut down to\nthe ground, You who weakened the nations!\u201d (Isa. 14:12).\nJesus said, \u201c\u2026I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven\u201d (Luke 10:18).\nSome commentators believe these words are prophetic and refer to the event\nrecorded in Revelation 12:9: \u201cSo the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of\nold, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to\nthe earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\u201d Others believe these words\nof Jesus look back to the historic judgment of Lucifer when he was expelled\nfrom Heaven and became Satan.\nThere are two scriptures that point to Satan having some sort of access to\nHeaven. First, Job states, \u201c\u2026when the sons of God came to present themselves\nbefore the Lord, and Satan also came among them. And the Lord said to Satan,\n\u2018From where do you come?\u2019 So Satan answered the Lord and said, \u2018From going\nto and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it\u2019\u201d (Job 1:6-7).\nThis passage seems to imply that Satan and the sons of God were standing before\nthe Lord in heaven. The second passage that demonstrates Satan\u2019s possible access\nto heaven is found in Revelation 12:10 where the devil is portrayed as bringing\naccusation against the brethren, \u201cbefore our God day and night.\u201d Regardless of\nSatan\u2019s possible access to Heaven, after he was expelled for his wicked pride and\nrebellion, he never held his former position of honor and influence.\nOne might ask how a holy being in a holy place could originate the first\nsin and suffer such a great fall. The answer is the devil\u2019s condition is the result\nof his own sin and willful rebellion: \u201cFor you have said in your heart: \u2018I will\nascend\u2026I will exalt\u2026I will be like the Most High\u2019\u201d (Isa. 14:13-14). The devil\nis self-condemned.\nE. Satan\u2019s character\nOne of Satan\u2019s greatest devices in opposing the work of the Lord is his\ndeceptiveness. Through the centuries he has posed in roles that have caused\n\npeople to think of him in many ways other than his true character. This has\nmade it easier for Satan to lead people away from God. F.C. Jennings wrote\nabout how false notions of Satan have led people to reject any belief in Satan:\nIn considering the person of Satan, it may be well first to\nlook at the common, vulgar, popular idea, such as is still\nheld by the masses of Christendom, and such as is made\nthe basis, or one of the bases, for the rejection of his very\nexistence by many of the \u201clearned\u201d of the day. The lowest\npossible, and yet the most widespread conception we have\nis in what one may term the stage idea, as we constantly see\nit on the posters in our streets. A human form, with leering\nface, characterized by a grin of low cunning, horns, hoofs,\nand forked tail; utterly obscene, and provoking nothing but\ncontempt, ridicule, and disgust.1\nThe Bible certainly does not present such a picture of Satan. If he came\nin such a guise, no one would follow him. Contrary to the popular notion,\nSatan\u2019s dominant purpose is not to be unlike God or the opposite of God.\nRather, his transcendent objective is to be like God, to \u201cbe like the most\nHigh\u201d (Isa. 14:14). Scripture gives a great number of different names and\ndescriptive titles for Satan. We will examine Satan\u2019s names and titles to recog-\nnize his various approaches and to reveal his true character.\nF. Names and titles given to Satan\n1. Lucifer\nThe King James Version and the New King James Version both use the\nword Lucifer from the Latin Vulgate to translate the Hebrew word Heylel in\nIsaiah 14:12. Heylel literally means \u201ca shining one.\u201d The Latin Vulgate word\nLucifer means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201cmorning-star.\u201d The name Lucifer seems to refer\nto Satan\u2019s position in Heaven before his rebellion and fall: \u201cHow you are fallen\nfrom heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\u201d (Isa. 14:12). The Bible indicates\n1 Frederick Charles Jennings, Satan, His Person, Work and Destiny (Neptune, NJ: Loizeaux Brothers) 12.\n\nthat Satan occupied an exalted position in the heavens. Individuals should be\nmindful of the devil\u2019s former position, for although he is now wicked, he has not\nlost all of the qualities or attributes he had when he was first created. Satan does\nnot come to us as a hideous creature out of hell but as one who formerly occu-\npied the heights. Therefore, his appeals will sometimes seem to be high and lofty.\n2. Satan\n\u201cSatan\u201d is a Hebrew word that means adversary or one who opposes. A\ntransliteration of the Hebrew word Satan is also used in the New Testament.\nSatan is used 55 times in the Old and New Testaments. The term Satan illus-\ntrates his malicious and persistent attempts to hinder God\u2019s program. As the\nenemy, he is opposed to everything and every person that is good. He is the\nadversary of both God and all humans. Peter warned the church of \u201c\u2026your\nadversary the devil\u2026\u201d (1 Peter 5:8). Paul wrote to the Thessalonian church\nand told the saints there: \u201cTherefore we wanted to come to you\u2014even I,\nPaul, time and again\u2014but Satan hindered us\u201d (1 Thess. 2:18).\n3. Devil\nDevil is one of the four names for Satan used in Revelation 20:2: \u201cHe\nlaid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan\u2026\u201d\nThe name \u201cdevil\u201d particularly signifies slanderer and accuser. Satan accuses\nboth God and humans. The devil accused God, through the serpent, when\ntempting Eve: \u201cThen the serpent said to the woman, \u2018You will not surely die.\nFor God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and\nyou will be like God, knowing good and evil\u2019\u201d (Gen. 3:4-5). Satan also makes\naccusations about humans to God. In Revelation 12:10 we read of Satan as\n\u201c\u2026the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and\nnight\u2026\u201d but \u201c\u2026has been cast down.\u201d The use of \u201cdevil\u201d to refer to Satan\noccurs thirty-five times in the New Testament.\n4. Serpent\nSatan is first seen in his activity on earth as a serpent (Gen. 3:1-15). Paul\nwrote, \u201cBut I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness,\n\nso your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ\u201d\n(2 Cor. 11:3). The serpent mentioned in Genesis 3 should not be viewed in\nthe same manner as the slithering, crawling serpents we know today. The\npresent condition of serpents came only as a result of the curse upon them\nwhen God said to the serpent, \u201c\u2026Because you have done this, You are cursed\nmore than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you\nshall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life\u201d (Gen. 3:14). Prior\nto the curse, the serpent most likely walked upright and was a most beautiful\ncreature. More importantly, individuals should realize that in the temptation\nof Eve, the serpent was not acting as a mere animal, for the Scripture portrays\nthe serpent as speaking, arguing and reasoning. Therefore, we conclude that\nSatan spoke through the serpent. Revelation 12:9 and 20:2 both speak of\nSatan as \u201cthat serpent of old.\u201d The name serpent denotes crookedness, deceit-\nfulness and guile.\n5. Dragon\nIn Revelation 20:2 Satan is specifically identified as \u201c\u2026the dragon, that\nserpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan.\u201d Also, in Revelation 12:9 we read,\n\u201cSo the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and\nSatan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels\nwere cast out with him.\u201d Verse seven of the same chapter tells us: \u201cAnd war\nbroke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the\ndragon and his angels fought\u2026\u201d The word \u201cdragon\u201d is literally \u201csea mon-\nster.\u201d The name dragon refers to Satan\u2019s great power. This is clearly seen in\nRevelation 13:2: \u201cNow the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were\nlike the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon\ngave him his power, his throne, and great authority.\u201d\n6. Beelzebub or Beelzebul\nThe name Beelzebub means \u201cLord of flies.\u201d As Beelzebub, Satan is\nparticularly seen as \u201cthe ruler of the demons\u201d (Matt. 12:24; Mark 3:22;\nLuke 11:15). The Pharisees accused Jesus of casting out demons through\nthe authority of Beelzebub: \u201cNow when the Pharisees heard it they said,\n\u2018This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the\n\ndemons\u2019\u201d (Matt. 12:24). Jesus warned His disciples that just as He was called\nBeelzebub, they too would be vilified: \u201cIf they have called the master of the\nhouse Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!\u201d\n(Matt. 10:25). Beelzebub is used in the context of Satan being the ultimate\nleader over a vast host of demons.\n7. Belial\nBelial is a Hebrew word meaning \u201cworthless.\u201d It is used in the Old\nTestament to designate corrupt, rebellious and wicked men (Deut. 13:13;\nJudg. 20:13; 1 Sam. 10:27; 30:22). Belial is used once in the New Testament\nto represent Satan: \u201cAnd what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has\na believer with an unbeliever?\u201d (2 Cor. 6:15). The name implies that Satan is\n\u201cthe worthless one\u201d who does not give or add value to anything or anyone.\n8. Tempter\nAs tempter, Satan constantly incites people to sin. Satan desires to destroy\nthe faith of believers through temptation: \u201cFor this reason, when I could no\nlonger endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter\nhad tempted you, and our labor might be in vain\u201d (1 Thess. 3:5). Satan used\ntemptation when trying to prevent Jesus from pursuing His calling: \u201cNow\nwhen the tempter came to Him, he said, \u2018If You are the Son of God, com-\nmand that these stones become bread\u2019\u201d (Matt. 4:3). Whereas God tests indi-\nviduals for their good so that they may learn and become stronger (James\n1:2-3), Satan tempts people for the purpose of destroying their faith, calling\nand lives.\n9. Wicked one or evil one\nThough Satan\u2019s ways may be varied and deceiving, they are always for\nwicked and evil purposes: \u201cWe know that we are of God, and the whole world\nlies under the sway of the wicked one\u201d (1 John 5:19). Jesus frequently referred\nto Satan as the wicked one or evil one: \u201c\u2026then the wicked one comes and\nsnatches away what was sown in his heart\u201d (Matt. 13:19). Jesus said, \u201cThe\n\nfield is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares\nare the sons of the wicked one\u201d (Matt. 13:38). Jesus taught His followers to\npray \u201cAnd do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one\u201d\n(Luke 11:4). John twice declared that he was writing to \u201cfathers\u201d and \u201cyoung\nmen\u201d because they had \u201c\u2026overcome the wicked one\u201d (1 John 2:13-14). Paul\ndeclared, \u201cBut the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from\nthe evil one\u201d (2 Thess. 3:3).\n10. Ruler of this world\nJesus referred to Satan as \u201cthe ruler of this world\u201d three times: \u201cNow\nis the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out\u201d\n(John 12:31); \u201cI will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this\nworld is coming, and he has nothing in Me\u201d (John 14:30); \u201c\u2026of judgment,\nbecause the ruler of this world is judged\u201d (John 16:11). This title speaks of\nSatan\u2019s rule and influence over governments, world politics, businesses, insti-\ntutions and societies who do not serve God. Satan has a domain where he\nexercises his authority, and he has a throne from where he attempts to rule: \u201cI\nknow your works, and where you dwell, where Satan\u2019s throne is\u201d (Rev. 2:13).\nDuring Jesus\u2019 temptation in the wilderness, when the devil offered Him \u201cthe\nkingdoms of the world and their glory,\u201d Jesus did not deny Satan\u2019s power\nto make such an offer. God gave Adam and Eve dominion over the earth\n(Gen. 1:26). However, because Adam and Eve disobeyed the word of the\nLord and followed Satan, they yielded their dominion to the devil. Whenever\nand wherever individuals yield their lives to Satan\u2019s authority, he becomes the\nruler of their world. Although Satan is referred to as \u201cthe ruler of this world,\u201d\nhe is still under the dominion of God and must recognize the One who reigns\nsupreme above him.\n11. Prince of the power of the air\nPaul referred to Satan as the \u201c\u2026the prince of the power of the air, the\nspirit who now works in the sons of disobedience\u2026\u201d (Eph. 2:2). This title\nsuggests Satan\u2019s rulership over those spirit-beings who share his rebellion or\nsin against God: \u201cFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against\nprincipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,\n\nagainst spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\u201d (Eph. 6:12; see\nalso Matt. 12:24; 25:41; Rev. 12:7).\n12. God of this age\nWriting to the Corinthian church, Paul stated, \u201cBut even if our gospel\nis veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this\nage has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory\nof Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them\u201d (2 Cor. 4:3-4).\nThe title \u201cgod of this age\u201d points to Satan\u2019s desire to spiritually lead God\u2019s\ncreation. In seeking to be like the Most High, Satan desired spiritual lead-\nership. He desired others to follow, worship and praise him. Satan\u2019s attempt\nto be the \u201cgod of this age\u201d is his most devastating attack against God. The\nScripture gives many examples of how Satan operates as god of this age: he\nattends religious gatherings (Job 1); he has religious teachings, \u201cdoctrines\nof demons\u201d (1 Tim. 4:1); he has meeting places, \u201csynagogue of Satan\u201d (Rev.\n2:9); people provide him sacrifices, \u201c\u2026the things which the Gentiles sacrifice\nthey sacrifice to demons and not to God\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 10:20); and he has his\nown ministers, \u201cTherefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform\nthemselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to\ntheir works\u201d (2 Cor. 11:15). These \u201cministers\u201d of Satan sponsor all kinds of\nmaterialistic and humanistic religions and cults.\nF.C. Jennings aptly spoke to this theme:\nIn this present system of things looked at morally and\naway from God, he (Satan) so arranges not merely the pol-\nitics of earth, or its immoralities, but its religion\u2014for this\nis necessarily the force of this title \u201cGod\u201d as in contrast\nwith \u201cprince\u201d\u2014as to suit his own ends. He so weaves the\ncourse of this age: its religious forms, ceremonies, external\ndecencies, respectabilities, and conventionalities to form\na thick veil, that entirely hides \u201cthe glory of God in the\nface of Jesus Christ,\u201d which consists in righteous mercy to\npenitent sinners only. This veil is not formed by evil-liv-\ning, depravity, or any form of what passes as evil amongst\n\nmen; but by cold formality, heartless decency, proud\nself-complacency, highly esteemed external respectabil-\nity, and we must add, church-membership\u2014all without\nChrist. It is the most fatal of all delusions, the thickest of\nall veils, and the most common. It is the way that, because\nit is religious, respectable, decent \u201cseems right unto a man\nbut the end thereof is death\u201d; for there is no Christ, no\nLamb of God, no Blood of Atonement in it.2\n13. Deceiver\nIf there is any name appropriate for the arch-enemy of God it is this: the\ndeceiver. Revelation repeatedly refers to Satan as the deceiver: \u201cThe devil,\nwho deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire\u2026\u201d (Rev. 20:10); \u201cSo the\ngreat dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan,\nwho deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth\u2026\u201d (Rev. 12:9); \u201cHe\nlaid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan,\nand bound him for a thousand years; and he cast him into the bottomless\npit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the\nnations no more till the thousand years were finished\u201d (Rev. 20:2-3). Having\nlearned nothing from his one thousand year incarceration in the \u201cbottomless\npit,\u201d Satan immediately goes \u201c\u2026out to deceive the nations which are in the\nfour corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle,\nwhose number is as the sand of the sea\u201d (Rev. 20:8). This is his last great\nattempt to deceive the nations into thinking they can triumph over God,\nand that it will be to their advantage to follow the \u201cruler of this world.\u201d Satan\nmust deceive individuals to influence them to forsake God and to follow him.\nOnly those who are deceived would reject the love of God and march under\nSatan\u2019s banner.\n14. Accuser\nSatan is the accuser: \u201c\u2026for the accuser of our brethren, who accused\nthem before our God day and night\u201d (Rev. 12:10). Not satisfied with only\n2 Jennings, 29-30.\n\ndirecting his energies and forces against the saints, he also unceasingly accuses\nbelievers before God. Imagine the arrogance of one who would accuse, in\nthe presence of God, those who have been redeemed through the precious\nblood of God\u2019s own Son. The classic example of Satan as the accuser is when\nSatan dared to say that Job would curse God to His face if God lifted His\nhedge of protection and allowed Satan to touch Job\u2019s possessions (Job 1:10-\n11) Regardless of Satan\u2019s accusations, Christians can trust God\u2019s hand of pro-\ntection. Notice the triumphant notes of victory that accompany this great\nproclamation of the accuser\u2019s downfall: \u201cThen I heard a loud voice saying in\nheaven, \u2018Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the\npower of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused\nthem before our God day and night, has been cast down\u2019\u201d (Rev. 12:10).\n15. Angel of Light\nSatan can transform into an angel of light:\nFor such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming\nthemselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For\nSatan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.\nTherefore it is no great thing if his ministers also trans-\nform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose\nend will be according to their works (2 Cor. 11:13-15).\nThis is perhaps the greatest deceptive role Satan plays; He poses as a\nspiritual helper to lead those who need help out of their darkness. Yet his only\npurpose is to guide them into ever-increasing darkness, deceiving them under\nthe impression that they are coming more and more into the light. How true\nare the words of Jesus, \u201cIf therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how\ngreat is that darkness!\u201d (Matt. 6:23).\n16. Murderer\nWhen addressing His enemies, Jesus called Satan a murderer, \u201cYou are\nof your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was\n\na murderer from the beginning\u2026\u201d (John 8:44). Jesus clearly contrasted the\nmurdering purposes of Satan. He proclaimed: \u201cI have come that they may\nhave life, and that they may have it more abundantly\u201d (John 10:10). Satan\nhas been a murderer from the beginning, for he is the originator of sin, and\nsin brings death. Through tempting humans to sin, Satan is promoting death.\n17. Father of lies\nIn John 8:44 Jesus also described the devil as the father of lies: \u201cHe\u2026does\nnot stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie,\nhe speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.\u201d Lying is\na chief characteristic of Satan. He is a deceiver, and lies are his favorite devices.\nSatan specializes in all forms of lies: from the most apparent falsehood to lies\nwith just enough truth in them to trick the unwary. There was a measure of\ntruth in what he said to Eve. Adam and Eve did come to know good and evil,\nbut they did not become more like God; they suffered death and dreadful\nconsequences (Gen. 3:4-5). Satan will even use Scripture as he did with Jesus\n(Matt. 4:6), but he will always misquote or misapply it. Satan communicates\nto lie and to deceive. He does not speak truth.\n18. Roaring lion\nSatan is depicted as a roaring lion: \u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because your\nadversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may\ndevour\u201d (1 Pet. 5:8). Satan is pictured as a serpent to denote his subtlety but\nas a lion to express his fierceness and strength. The word translated \u201croaring\u201d\nis used especially of the cries of wild beasts when they are ravenous with hun-\nger. Believers are told to \u201cResist him, steadfast in the faith\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 5:9).\n19. Destroyer\n\u201cAnd they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose\nname in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon\u201d\n(Rev. 9:11; 1 Cor. 10:10). Both of these names, Abaddon or Apollyon, mean\n\u201cdestroyer\u201d or \u201cone who brings to ruin.\u201d\n\nG. Satan\u2019s defeat\nThough currently allowed to continue his activities in the earth, Satan is\na defeated foe. He has already suffered much under the hand of God whom\nhe dared to oppose. It is very helpful for Christians in their daily conflicts\nwith the devil to be aware of and rejoice in Satan\u2019s defeat.\n1. Satan lost his exalted position in Heaven\nImmediately after his five bold \u201cI will\u201d assertions are recorded in Isaiah\n14:12-14, the Scripture announces Satan\u2019s fall: \u201cYet you shall be brought\ndown to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit\u201d (Isa. 14:15). Jesus may have\nbeen referring to this event when He said, \u201cI saw Satan fall like lightning from\nheaven\u201d (Luke 10:18). Although Scripture indicates Satan has some access\nto the presence of God when he accuses the brethren (Rev. 12:10), he never\nregained the lofty position he once held.\n2. Satan was cursed in the Garden of Eden\nSo the Lord God said to the serpent: \u201cBecause you have\ndone this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more\nthan every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go,\nAnd you shall eat dust All the days of your life. And I will\nput enmity Between you and the woman, And between\nyour seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head,\nAnd you shall bruise His heel (Gen. 3:14-15).\nThough this curse is directed against all serpents, the reference to the\nenmity certainly goes beyond the serpent to Satan himself. This curse is\nbetween Satan and humanity as well as between Satan and the Seed of Eve,\nJesus Christ. This curse against the devil will never be lifted. In spite of all\nhis boldness, Satan surely realizes that he carries the weight of the curse upon\nhim at all times.\n\n3. Satan failed to turn Christ aside from His mission\nThree times Satan sought to turn Christ aside from His divine mission\nhere on earth, and three times Jesus unsheathed the \u201csword of the Spirit,\u201d\nthe Word of God, and declared, \u201cIt is written\u201d (Matt. 4:3-10). Christ never\ndeparted from the purposes of God as expressed in His Word. The result was\n\u201cThen the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him\u201d\n(Matt. 4:11).\n4. Satan was judged at the cross of Calvary\nJust prior to His condemnation and crucifixion, Jesus said, \u201cNow is\nthe judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out\u201d\n(John 12:31). Referring to this same event on Calvary, Jesus prophesied\nthat the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin, righteousness and\njudgment: \u201cof judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged\u201d (John\n16:11). Through His death on the cross, Jesus destroyed \u201c\u2026him who had\nthe power of death, that is, the devil\u201d (Heb. 2:14). Paul speaks in glowing\nterms of the victory over Satan at the cross: \u201cHaving disarmed principalities\nand powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in\nit\u201d (Col. 2:15).\nIf Satan\u2019s defeat was so triumphant at Calvary, then why is he still allowed\nto harass the church of Jesus Christ? Even after the cross, Satan is still called\n\u201cthe prince of the power of the air\u201d (Eph. 2:2), and \u201cthe god of this age\u201d\n(2 Cor. 4:4). There is a vast difference between a judgment gained and the\ncarrying out of the penalty. There is no doubt of the judgment rendered\nagainst Satan at the cross; but for good reasons, best known to God, Satan\nis still allowed a degree of freedom. Certainly, God does not lack the power\nto destroy the devil. He has set the time for Satan\u2019s final defeat (Rev. 20:10).\nH. Satan\u2019s destiny\n1. Satan will be finally cast out of heaven\nAnd war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels\nfought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels\n\nfought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for\nthem in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast\nout, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who\ndeceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his\nangels were cast out with him (Rev. 12:7-9).\nFrom that time on, his wickedness will be confined to this earth.\n2. Satan will be confined to the bottomless pit\nThen I saw an angel coming down from heaven, hav-\ning the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his\nhand. He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who\nis the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand\nyears; and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut\nhim up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive\nthe nations no more till the thousand years were finished.\nBut after these things he must be released for a little while\n(Rev. 20:1-3).\nAt the beginning of the Millennial reign of Christ, Satan will be bound\nin the bottomless pit, literally \u201cthe abyss.\u201d It seems logical to presume that the\ndemon hosts will be there with him. They are cast out of heaven with him\n(Rev. 12:9), so it would seem they would be bound with him in the abyss.\nAfter the thousand years is finished, he is to be loosed for a little while at\nwhich time he will conduct his last campaign of deceit. The rebellious army\nhe gathers will be destroyed with fire from God out of heaven (Rev. 20:7-9).\n3. Satan will be consigned to the lake of fire\n\u201cThe devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brim-\nstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented\nday and night forever and ever\u201d (Rev. 20:10). After the last group of humans\nhas been tested, and Satan has ended his work, the devil will be consigned by\nGod to the lake of fire where he will be tormented forever.\n\nI. The believer\u2019s course of action regarding Satan\n1. Recognize Satan\u2019s limitations\nHumans should never underestimate the devil. He is a sly and skillful\nfoe. He has had thousands of years of experience dealing with humankind.\nHowever, humans should also not overestimate Satan\u2019s abilities. He has cer-\ntain definitive limitations. These should be fully known so that no one will\nbe overwhelmed by him.\na) Satan is not omnipotent. He has great power, more than any person.\nOnly our God is all-powerful, and Satan is no match for Him.\nb) Satan is not omniscient. He has a very keen intellect and from expe-\nrience knows many things, far more than humans. However, only God is\nall-knowing.\nc) Satan is not omnipresent. Satan has an individual personality and is\nonly in one place at one time. Because of the great number of the demons\nunder his control, it seems as if the devil is everywhere at the same time.\nMany so-called attacks by the devil are the activity of one of his assisting\ndemons. Only God is always everywhere.\nd) The devil cannot bestow life or raise anyone from the dead. Jesus said,\n\u201cThe thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy\u2026\u201d (John\n10:10).\n2. Realize that Satan\u2019s power is limited by the will of God\nThis is clearly seen in the story of Satan, God and Job (Job 1:10). \u201cHave\nYou not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all\nthat he has on every side?\u201d Satan could touch none of Job\u2019s possessions or\nhis person until God gave him permission (see also Job 2:4-6). Jesus said to\nPeter, \u201cSimon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you\n\nas wheat\u201d (Luke 22:31). The implication is Satan could not have Peter for this\npurpose without the Lord\u2019s permission.\n3. Realize that Satan has been conquered\nThe Scripture states that Satan has been conquered: \u201cFor this purpose the\nSon of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil\u201d\n(1 John 3:8). Satan is a conquered foe, overcome by our Lord Jesus Christ.\nNowhere are Christians told to fight the devil. Jesus fought Satan once and\nfor all on the cross. Our part is to claim, by faith, and stand in His victory.\nBelievers are not commanded to fight the devil but to \u201cResist the devil and\nhe will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7). First Peter 5:9 explains how believers are\nto resist Satan: \u201cResist him, steadfast in the faith.\u201d Faith in the account of\nChrist\u2019s victory over the devil and in God\u2019s promises is the secret of victory for\nbelievers. Jesus made Satan\u2019s tactics quite clear in the parable of the Sower and\nthe Seed. Jesus said some of the seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the\nair devoured it. Jesus explained: \u201cThose by the wayside are the ones who hear;\nthen the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they\nshould believe and be saved\u201d (Luke 8:12). The devil knew that if the Word\nwere allowed to remain in the hearts of the hearers, it would bring forth faith:\n\u201cSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d (Rom.\n10:17). Faith in God\u2019s Word is the secret to the believer\u2019s daily triumph. F.C.\nJennings summed up this truth:\nThis then suggests very clearly the root-aim of his attacks:\nit is always to destroy faith in God; and our side of the\nconflict is to maintain that faith in spite of everything\nhe can bring against it. So the apostle Peter says \u201cwhom\nresist steadfast in the faith;\u201d and our apostle\u2019s (Paul\u2019s) joy-\nful swan-song is: \u201cI have fought a good fight, I have fin-\nished my course, I have kept the faith\u201d (2 Tim. 4:7); and\nhe passes back the word to us \u201cfight the good fight of faith\u201d\n(1 Tim. 6:12).3\n3 Jennings, 140.\n\n4. Remember that Jesus intercedes on behalf of the believer\nThis is beautifully illustrated in the following verse: \u201cAnd the Lord said,\n\u2018Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as\nwheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail\u2026\u2019\u201d (Luke\n22:31-32; see also Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34).\n5. Practice unceasing vigilance\n\u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a\nroaring lion, seeking whom he may devour\u201d (1 Pet. 5:8). Believers, knowing\nSatan\u2019s malice, cunning and power, will make it their supreme concern to\nbe watchful.\n6. Deny Satan any foothold\nPaul warned believers not to \u201c\u2026give place to the devil\u201d (Eph. 4:27).\nBelievers must not give the devil any place within their lives where he might\ngain a place or opportunity for attack. There was no place in Jesus where\nSatan could get a foothold. Jesus could say, \u201cfor the ruler of this world is\ncoming, and he has nothing in Me\u201d (John 14:30).\n7. Put on the whole armor of God\nTherefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may\nbe able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all,\nto stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with\ntruth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and\nhaving shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel\nof peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which\nyou will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked\none. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of\nthe Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with\nall prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to\n\nthis end with all perseverance and supplication for all the\nsaints (Eph. 6:13-18).\nThe Lord has provided a complete set of armor to protect Christians\nfrom every fiery dart of the wicked one. But believers must put on this armor,\nall of it. The omission of any one part may be fatal to their Christian life\nand testimony."};
