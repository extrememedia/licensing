The Lord takes pleasure\nin making Himself known to His children. God is love; love must always\ncommunicate itself, and that revelation must come from God. The thoughts\nof a person can only be disclosed by that person. Likewise, only God can\nmake Himself known. The God of the Bible is a God who speaks. He spoke\nthe universe into existence: \u201cBy the word of the Lord the heavens were made;\nand all the host of them by the breath of His mouth\u201d (Ps. 33:6). God has\nconveyed His will and purposes by speaking to chosen men and women with\nthe greatest of all His revelations being found in the Person of Jesus Christ,\nthe Word Incarnate: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\nGod, and the Word was God ... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among\nus, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,\nfull of grace and truth\u201d (John 1:1-14). Hebrews states, \u201cGod, who at various\ntimes and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,\nhas in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir\nof all things, through whom also He made the worlds\u201d (Heb. 1:1-2).\n\nGod preserved these revelations of Himself in the Bible. Some claim\nGod\u2019s revelation is best found in nature. They see no need for the special\nrevelation contained in the Bible. It is true that, if God is the creator of all\nnature, then nature will reveal much about the One who brought it into\nexistence (Rom. 1:20). However, nature\u2019s revelation of God is very limited.\nCertainly the God who created this amazing world and the vast universe of\nwhich the earth is a minute part must be a God of great wisdom and power.\nBut the revelation of nature is incomplete. Nature alone cannot fully reveal\nthe marvelous love of God, God\u2019s holiness or the grace of God that has pro-\nvided salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ. Rather, it is the written Word,\nthe Bible, that best reveals the testimony of God\u2019s great purposes and plans\nfor humanity.\nSome view the Bible as only a collection of stories about man\u2019s effort\nto find God. If this were so, the Bible would have no authority or sense of\ndivine revelation. Instead, it would merely be the account of humans groping\nfor truth they cannot obtain. The Bible is not just the story of humanity\u2019s\nattempts to find God. Rather, the Holy Scripture is the account of God\u2019s\neffort to reveal Himself to every human being. Consequently, it is tremen-\ndously important that we understand something concerning the Bible\u2019s ori-\ngin, formation, authority, inerrancy and divine inspiration. These issues will\nbe considered under the study of bibliology.\nI. The Names of the Scripture\nA. The Bible\nThe English word Bible comes from the Greek word biblos, meaning \u201ca\nbook.\u201d \u201cThe book [biblos] of the genealogy of Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Matt. 1:1).\nScripture also use biblion, a diminutive form of biblos, meaning \u201clittle book\u201d:\n\u201cAnd he was handed the book [biblion] of the prophet Isaiah. And when he\nhad opened the book [biblion]\u2026\u201d (Luke 4:17). Biblos comes from the word\ngiven to the inner pulp of the papyrus reed on which ancient scrolls (books)\nwere written.\n\nB. Other names\nThe Bible is also called Scripture (Mark 12:10; 15:28; Luke 4:21; John\n2:22; 7:38; 10:35; Rom. 4:3; Gal. 4:30; 2 Pet. 1:20) and the Scriptures (Matt.\n22:29; Mark 12:24; Luke 24:27; John 5:39; Acts 17:11; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; 2 Pet.\n3:16). These terms signify holy writings. Paul also used the Holy Scriptures\n(Rom. 1:2; 2 Tim. 3:15) and the oracles of God (Rom. 3:2). One of the\nmost descriptive and satisfying names is the Word of God (Mark 7:13; Rom.\n10:17; 2 Cor. 2:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; Heb. 4:12).\nII. The Divisions of the Scripture\nA. The two testaments\nThe Bible is divided into two sections known as the Old Testament and\nthe New Testament. The word testament was originally translated \u201ccove-\nnant\u201d to signify the Old and New Testament are both covenants God made\nwith His people. There are 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 in the\nNew Testament.\nB. Divisions in the Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Old Testament was commonly divided into three sections:\n1. The Law (Torah):\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy\n2. The Prophets (Nebhiim):\nFormer Prophets: Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings\nand 2 Kings\nLatter Prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, The Twelve (Hosea, Joel,\nAmos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,\nZechariah, Malachi)\n\n3. The Writings (Kethbhim):\nPoetical Books: Psalms, Proverbs, Job\nFive Rolls (Megillot): Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations,\nEsther, Ecclesiastes\nHistorical Books: Daniel, Ezra/Nehemiah (combined), 1 Chronicles\nand 2 Chronicles1\nThese divisions are in keeping with Jesus\u2019 words, \u201cThese are the words\nwhich I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled\nwhich were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms\nconcerning Me\u201d (Luke 24:44). Sometimes the Old Testament is referred to as\nthe Law and the Prophets (Matt. 5:17; 11:13; Acts 13:15) or simply the Law\n(John 10:34; 12:34; 15:25; 1 Cor. 14:21).\nC. Divisions in the New Testament\n1. Biographical: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John\n2. Historical: Acts\n3. Pedagogical: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians,\nEphesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians,\n1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter,\n1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude\n4. Prophetic: Revelation\nSometimes the following alternate divisions are suggested:\nThe Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John\nThe Acts of the Apostles\n1 This order is suggested in Norman L.Geisler and William E. Nix, From God to Us: How We Got Our Bible\n(Chicago: Moody Press, 1974) 10. They state their source as The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic\nText, and Rudolf Kittel and Paul Kahle, eds., Biblia Hebraica (Stuttgart: Wurttembergische Bibelanstalt\nStuttgart, 1937).\n\nThe Epistles of Paul\nThe General Epistles\nThe Book of Revelation2\nD. Chapters and verses\nThe Bible was not originally divided into chapters and verses. For con-\nvenience of reference, these were added much later. It was once assumed\nthat chapter divisions were first introduced by Cardinal Hugo (died 1263).\nLater investigations attribute the divisions to Stephen Langton (died 1228),\nArchbishop of Canterbury. The New Testament was first published with verse\ndivisions by Robert Stephans in 1551. The first Bible to be published entirely\ndivided into verse was the Geneva Bible of 1560.\nIt is important to realize these divisions were not in the original texts\nand were not inspired. Most of the divisions are very helpful, but some have\nproven to be quite misleading, especially when a division comes in the middle\nof a specific event, idea or flow of thought. Chapter divisions tend to suggest\nthat a new subject is being introduced even though this is frequently not the\ncase. Consequently, it is important at times to ignore the chapter division\nwhen analyzing the meaning of the text. For example, when John 7:53 and\nJohn 8:1 are read together without the chapter break, a significant contrast is\nevident: \u201cAnd everyone went to his own house. But Jesus went to the Mount\nof Olives.\u201d\n2 William Evans, The Book of Books: What It Is; How to Study It (Chicago: The Bible Institute Colportage\nAssociation, 1902) 95.\n\nIII. The Writers of the Scripture\nThe Bible is one book, but it is also many books written by at least 40\nauthors over a period of not less than 1,500 years. Many of the authors never\nmet each other, yet the Bible\u2019s unity and continuity is so apparent; it is easy to\nthink of it as having just one author, God Himself.\nOf the 66 different books in the Bible, the authors of 55 are well identi-\nfied by history and tradition. The 11 books whose authors are not known are\nJudges, Ruth, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and\n2 Chronicles, Esther, Job and Hebrews. Some books, such as Genesis, Judges,\n1 Kings and 2 Kings, and 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, cover such long\nperiods of history it is possible that they are collections of ancient records\nbrought together and edited by one individual towards the end of the histor-\nical period described in the book.\nFor instance, Moses could be the compiler of the book of Genesis. If this\nis so, then the actual number of writers contributing to the Bible may be con-\nsiderably more than 40. Psalms and Proverbs have several authors. The super-\nscriptions that appear at the head of many of the Psalms suggest at least seven\ndifferent writers. In addition to naming Solomon as the author of Proverbs,\ntwo other authors are mentioned. Agur is mentioned in Proverbs 30:1 and\nKing Lemuel in Proverbs 31:1.\nAll of the authors, with the exception of Luke, were Jews and wrote in the\ncontext of the Jewish religion. Yet the words they wrote have more universal\nappeal and interest to people of all nations than any words ever written. Also\nsignificant is the variety of occupations represented by the known authors:\nDavid and Solomon were kings.\nJeremiah and Ezekiel were priests.\nLuke was a physician.\nPeter and John were fishermen.\nMoses and Amos were shepherds.\nPaul was a Pharisee and a theologian.\nDaniel was a statesman.\n\nMatthew was a tax collector.\nJoshua was a soldier.\nEzra was a scribe.\nNehemiah was a butler.\nIV. The Canon of the Scripture\nThe word canon comes from the Greek kanon, meaning \u201ca measuring rod\nor reed,\u201d and signifies a rule or standard. Hence, the Canon of the Bible con-\nsists of those books considered worthy to be included in the Holy Scripture.\nAccording to authors Selby and West, the Canon\u2019s formation went far beyond\nreligious edicts:\nCanonization was the result of a centuries-long devel-\nopment, whereby only those writings that proved useful\nfor faith and worship were elevated to such a decisive\nrole. The Canon, that is to say, was determined not so\nmuch by Rabbinic or church decree as by the intrin-\nsic merit of each separate book and its reception by the\nworshipping community for the inspiration or edifica-\ntion it offered.3\nN.H. Ridderbos expressed the concept this way: \u201cThe various books pos-\nsessed and exercised divine authority long before men ever made pronounce-\nments to that effect. Ecclesiastical councils did not give the books their divine\nauthority but merely recognized that they both had it and exercised it.\u201d4\n3 Donald J. Selby and James King West, Introduction to the Bible (NewYork: The Macmillan Company,\n1971) 2.\n4 N.H. Ridderbos, The New Bible Dictionary, 187; as quoted in Roland K. Harrison, Introduction to the Old\nTestament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1969) 263.\n\nA. The Canon of the Old Testament\nScholars have many opinions concerning when the Canon of the Old\nTestament was closed. The Old Testament says nothing on the close of the\nCanon; however, it does contain many passages concerning God\u2019s desire that\nHis word should be written down, read and followed. Exodus 17 tells of the\nvictory of the children of Israel over Amalek as Moses\u2019 hands were held up\nbefore the Lord. Exodus 17:14 reads: \u201cThen the LORD said to Moses, \u2018Write\nthis for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua\u2026\u2019\u201d\nExodus 24:3-4 records the writing of God\u2019s words and judgments: \u201cSo Moses\ncame and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the judgments.\nAnd all the people answered with one voice and said, \u2018All the words which the\nLORD has said we will do.\u2019 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 31 gives the account of Moses writing the Law, which was to\nbe read to the people of Israel every seven years:\nSo Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests,\nthe sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD, and to all the elders of Israel. And Moses com-\nmanded them, saying: \u201cAt the end of every seven years,\nat the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast\nof Tabernacles, when all Israel comes to appear before\nthe LORD your God in the place which He chooses,\nyou shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing\u201d\n(Deut. 31:9-11).\nThis occasion could well mark the earliest beginning of the Old Testament\nCanon, for we read: \u201cMoses commanded the Levites\u2026saying: \u2018Take this Book\nof the Law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God,\nthat it may be there as a witness against you\u2026\u2019\u201d (Deut. 31:25-26). Joshua,\nMoses\u2019 successor, also wrote words, \u201cin the Book of the Law of God\u201d (Josh.\n24:26). Samuel recorded certain events of his day in a book: \u201cThen Samuel\nexplained to the people the behavior of royalty and wrote it in a book and\nlaid it up before the LORD\u201d (1 Sam. 10:25, RSV). Prophets in later times\nengaged in writing books. God spoke to Jeremiah and said: \u201cTake a scroll of\na book and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel,\n\nagainst Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from\nthe days of Josiah even to this day\u201d (Jer. 36:2).\nLater generations were found consulting the writings of their predeces-\nsors. Daniel searched \u201cin the books\u201d and found the prophet Jeremiah recorded\nthat the duration in which Jerusalem was to be ravaged by the enemy was\nto be 70 years (Dan. 9:2). Later, when the people were assembled back in\nJerusalem after the Babylonian captivity, it was the Law of Moses that was\nread and honored (Neh. 8:18). During the reign of Josiah in Judah, the Book\nof the Law of the Lord, which had been lost, was found: \u201cThen Hilkiah the\nhigh priest said to Shaphan the scribe, \u2018I have found the Book of the Law in\nthe house of the LORD\u2019\u201d (2 Kings 22:8). Josiah gathered the elders of Judah\nand Jerusalem together: \u201cAnd he read in their hearing all the words of the\nBook of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD\u201d\n(2 Kings 23:2). Thus, we see the beginnings of what later became the Old\nTestament Scriptures.\nGeorge L. Robinson\u2019s article in the International Standard Bible\nEncyclopedia concludes (following the Hebrew\u2019s threefold division of the Old\nTestament) that the books of the Law were recognized as canonical during the\ntime of Ezra (444 B.C.); the Prophets were recognized around 200 B.C.; and\nthe Writings received authorization around 100 B.C. Robinson is not saying\nthere were three separate canons, but that \u201cthere were three separate classes of\nwritings, which between 450 B.C. and 100 B.C. doubtless stood on different\nbases, and only gradually became recognized as authoritative.\u201d5\nOther scholars hold to the belief that there were only two periods of canon-\nization corresponding to \u201cthe law and the prophets,\u201d and that the Old Testament\nCanon was completed about 400 B.C.6 It is difficult to say which of these posi-\ntions is correct. What is important is the Old Testament Canon was, no doubt,\ncomplete at the time of Christ. Jesus referred to it as \u201cthe Scriptures,\u201d saying,\n\u201cYou search the Scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life\u2026\u201d (John\n5:39). We read: \u201cAnd beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded\n5 George L. Robinson, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans\nPublishing Company, 1943) I, 554-563.\n6 Geisler and Nix, 85.\n\nto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself\u201d (Luke 24:27). In\nLuke 11:51 Jesus made an interesting statement speaking of the time \u201c\u2026from\nthe blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar\nand the temple.\u201d Jesus was referring to the martyrs of the Old Testament. Abel\nwas the first, as recorded in Genesis 4, and Zechariah was the last, recorded in 2\nChronicles 24:20-21. In the Hebrew Bible, 2 Chronicles is the last book, while\nGenesis is the first. Thus, Jesus not only put His stamp of approval upon the\nentire Old Testament, from Genesis to 2 Chronicles, but gave indication that\nthese books were in existence and were approved at the time He was on earth.\nAs further evidence of the completeness of the Old Testament Canon at the\ntime of Jesus, we have the testimony of the celebrated Jewish historian Flavius\nJosephus. In Against Apion, he wrote:\nFor we have not an innumerable multitude of books\namong us, disagreeing from and contradicting one\nanother, (like the Greeks have) but only twenty-two\nbooks, which contain the records of all the past times;\nwhich we justly believe to be divine ... and how firmly\nwe have given credit to these books of our own nation is\nevident by what we do; for during so many ages as have\nalready passed, no one has been so bold as either to add\nanything to them, to take anything from them or to\nmake any change in them; but it is become natural to all\nJews immediately, and from their very birth, to esteem\nthese books to contain Divine doctrines, and to persist\nin them, and, if occasion be, willingly to die for them.7\nIn the Christian Bible, there are 39 books in the Old Testament, while the\nJewish Old Testament has only 24. This is because the Jewish Old Testament\ncounts the 12 books of the Minor Prophets (Hosea through Malachi) as one\nbook. Also, the book pairings of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings,\n1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles and Ezra/Nehemiah are considered one book\neach in the Jewish Old Testament. Josephus counted 22 Old Testament books\n7 The Life and Works of Flavius Josephus, trans. William Whiston (Chicago: The John C. Winston Company,\n1936) 861-862.\n\nbecause he joined Ruth to Judges and Lamentations to Jeremiah. Regardless\nof the different ways the Old Testament Scriptures have been ordered, classi-\nfied and numbered, the wording of the books is the same.\nB. The Canon of the New Testament\nIt is much easier to trace the canonization of the New Testament than\nthe Old Testament because far more evidence is available. The books of the\nNew Testament were written during the last half of the first century A.D.\nThe newly-formed Christian church had the Old Testament Scripture as the\nbasis for their faith. In addition to the Old Testament, great importance was\nplaced on the words of Jesus and the teachings of the apostles. Thus, it was\nnot long until the Gospels were being placed alongside of the Old Testament.\nThe authority of the apostles is fully attested. John declared, \u201c\u2026that which\nwe have seen and heard we declare to you\u201d (1 John 1:3). Peter wrote that the\napostles \u201cwere eyewitnesses of His majesty\u201c (2 Peter 1:16). In Acts we read\nthat the early believers \u201c\u2026continued stedfastly in the apostles\u2019 doctrine and\nfellowship\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:42).\nFrom their inception, the New Testament writings were widely distrib-\nuted. Paul wrote his epistles to meet the specific needs of local churches and\nindividuals. On several occasions, Paul gave definite instructions that his let-\nters should be read and circulated (Col. 4:16; 1 Thess. 5:27). As this practice\nspread, it is easy to see how compilations of Paul\u2019s letters became available.\nGod instructed John to send his book to the seven churches in Asia (Rev.\n1:11). The book of James was addressed to Jews dispersed throughout the\nworld (Jas. 1:1). Even Peter\u2019s first epistle was addressed \u201c\u2026the pilgrims of\nthe Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia ...\u201d (1 Pet.\n1:1). The following verses strongly suggest the early Christian church consid-\nered a compilation of apostolic writings to have the same authority as Old\nTestament Scripture:\n\u2026and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is sal-\nvation\u2014as also our beloved brother Paul, according to\nthe wisdom given to him, has written to you, as also in\nall his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which\n\nare some things hard to understand, which untaught and\nunstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do\nalso the rest of the Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16).\nEarly in the second century, the church fathers quoted copiously from\nthe writings that would later become the New Testament canon. Their rev-\nerential use of these writings validates the authority of the books from which\nthey quoted. The Gnostic Marcion (A.D. 140) compiled a canon rejecting\nmany letters and books that where considered authoritative to Christians.\nConsequently, many church leaders and scholars began to take a closer look\nat the need to define an agreed upon canon. Emperor Diocletian\u2019s persecution\nof the church (A.D. 302-305) also made it necessary for Christians to deter-\nmine the books for which they would suffer and die.\nWithin 25 years of the Diocletian persecutions, Emperor Constantine\nordered Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea and church historian, to prepare and\ndistribute 50 copies of the New Testament. Constantine\u2019s decree made it\nabsolutely necessary to decide which books should be included or exluded\nfrom the New Testament. By the end of the second century, the church recog-\nnized most of the 27 books of the New Testament as canonical. Seven books\nnot fully recognized at that time were Hebrews, 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, Jude,\nJames and Revelation. At the Third Council of Carthage (A.D. 397), the\nWestern Christian churches settled on the final form of the New Testament\nCanon. Thus, by the end of the fourth century, the church had received all\n27 books.\nC. Tests used to determine canonicity\nBiblical scholars have cited the following principles for determining a\nbook\u2019s right to be placed in the Canon:\n1. Apostolicity: Was the book authored by an apostle or someone closely\nassociated with the apostles? This criterion is especially important in relation\nto Mark, Luke, Acts and Hebrews since Mark and Luke were not among the\noriginal 12, and the authorship of Hebrews is uncertain.\n\n2. Spiritual content: Does the content of the book provide spiritual edifi-\ncation for the believer? This was a practical but necessary test.\n3. Doctrinal soundness: Is the content of the book doctrinally sound?\nAny book that contained teachings contrary to already accepted canonical\nbooks was rejected.\n4. Usage: Was the book universally recognized throughout the early\nchurch and widely quoted by the church fathers?\n5. Divine inspiration: Does the book give true evidence of divine inspi-\nration? However mysterious, \u201cThis was the ultimate test; everything finally\nhad to give way to it.\u201d8\nD. Writings excluded from the Canon\n1. The Apocrypha, meaning \u201chidden\u201d or \u201cconcealed,\u201d refers to books that\nare not part of the Protestant Bible but are considered inspired by some indi-\nviduals and communities of faith, particularly the Roman Catholic church.\nThe Old Testament Apocrypha contains 14 books: 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras,\nTobit, Judith, The Rest of Esther, The Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus,\nBaruch with the Epistle of Jeremiah, The Song of the Three Holy Children,\nThe History of Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, The Prayer of Manasses, 1\nMaccabees and 2 Maccabees. The Septuagint (LXX), the translation of the\nOld Testament into Greek made between 280 B.C. and 180 B.C., contained\nthe Apochryphal books. Jerome included them in his Latin translation of\nthe Old Testament called the Vulgate. These books are not a part of the\nHebrew Bible.\nThe books listed as the New Testament Apocrypha were those held in\nhigh esteem by at least one of the church fathers. Though they contain helpful\ninformation concerning the history of the church, they were never accepted\ninto the New Testament Canon. Some of the most popular of these writings\n8 Henry Clarence Thiessen, Introduction to the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans\nPublishing Company, 1948) 4th edition, 10.\n\nare The Epistle of Pseudo-Barnabas (70-79), The Epistle to the Corinthians\n(96), Shepherd of Hermas (115-140), The Didache (100-120), Epistle of\nPolycarp to the Philippians (108) and The Seven Epistles of Ignatius (110).\nThe Reformers were largely responsible for eliminating the Apocrypha from\nthe Bible because it contains things which are inconsistent with Protestant\ndoctrine (e.g. the doctrines of prayer for the dead and intercession to the\nsaints). Although parts of almost all the books of the Old Testament Canon\nare either quoted or directly referred to in the New Testament, there is no\nquotation or reference to any of the Apocryphal books.\n2. The Pseudepigrapha includes a group of spurious and heretical books\ngenerally considered false writings and never recognized by any council or\nquoted by the church fathers. A number of false doctrines are found in these\nbooks including the doctrines held by the Gnostics who denied the incarna-\ntion of Christ; the Docetics who denied the reality of Christ\u2019s humanity; and\nthe Monophysites who rejected the dual nature of Christ. The more than 280\npseudepigraphical writings are grouped under the headings Gospels, Acts,\nEpistles, Apocalypses and others. Geisler and Nix state: \u201cWhatever fragments\nof truth they preserve are obscured both by their religious fancy and heretical\ntendencies. The books are not only uncanonical but are not of much value for\nreligious or devotional purposes. Their main value is historical, revealing the\nbeliefs of their composers.\u201d9\nV. The Inerrancy of the Scripture\nA. Definition of inerrancy\nInerrancy as it applies to Scripture means the autographs (the original man-\nuscripts) contain no mistakes. In its original written languages, the Bible is\ninfallible\u2014without error whatsoever. For centuries this has been the position\nof evangelical churches. Some teach a \u201climited inerrancy,\u201d claiming the Bible to\nbe without error in matters of faith and practice, but not necessarily in matters\nof science and history. The problem with limited inerrancy is it leaves each\n9 Geisler and Nix, 116, 117.\n\nindividual as the arbiter of truth. The issue of inerrancy is vitally important; if\npeople do not have positive faith in the infallibility of the Bible, they are limited\nin their ability to speak with final authority concerning matters of eternity.\nB. The testimony of inerrancy\n1. The Bible testifies to its own inerrancy: The primary testimony to the\ndoctrine of inerrancy comes from the Scripture. There are many instances\nwhere the Bible claims to be inspired by God. Second Timothy 3:16 states:\n\u201cAll Scripture is given by inspiration of God\u2026\u201d The apostle Peter wrote, \u201cFor\nprophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they\nwere moved by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:21).\na) The Old Testament writers repeatedly asserted that they were\nspeaking the Word of God (2 Sam. 23:2; Isa. 1:2a; Jer. 1:7, 9). In fact,\n3,808 times they directly claimed to be transmitting God\u2019s words. Samuel\ndeclared, \u201cThe Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word was on\nmy tongue\u201d (2 Sam. 23:2).\nb) The New Testament writers also testified that the Old Testament\npresented the literal speech of God.\n(1) In the Gospels: Matthew refered to Old Testament scripture as\n\u201cspoken by the Lord through the prophet\u201d (Matt. 1:22). Luke stated,\n\u201cGod spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets\u201d (Luke 1:70). Mark\nnoted that the Psalms were written under the anointing of the Holy\nSpirit (Mark 12:36).\n(2) In the Epistles: The apostles gave witness to the perfection of\nOld Testament Scripture. Paul wrote, \u201cTherefore the law is holy, and\nthe commandment holy and just and good\u201d (Rom. 7:12). The author of\nHebrews regarded the Word of God as \u201cliving and powerful,\u201d going so\nfar as to judge even \u201cthe thoughts and intents of the heart\u201d (Heb. 4:12).\nJames described God\u2019s Word as \u201cthe perfect law of liberty\u201d (Jas. 1:25).\nJohn brought Revelation to a close with a warning to neither add nor take\naway from the words \u201cwhich are written in this book\u201d (Rev. 22:18-19).\n\n(3) The testimony of Jesus: Jesus specifically bore witness to the iner-\nrancy of the Scripture. He confirmed the whole of the Old Testament and\ndid not identify a single error or inconsistency. He continually based His\narguments and exhortations on the authority of the Old Testament. Jesus\nsaid, \u201c\u2026these are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you,\nthat all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and\nthe Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me\u201d (Luke 24:44). These three\nsections compose all of the Old Testament. Jesus referred to specific people\nand events, bearing testimony to the authenticity and authority of the Old\nTestament. Jesus put his stamp of approval on some of the events and mira-\ncles of the Old Testament that have received the greatest scrutiny by critics.\nThe following are some of the Old Testament events Jesus referenced:\nThe Creation and marriage Matthew 19:5\nThe Flood and Noah\u2019s ark Luke 17:26-27\nThe destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Luke 17:28-29\nThe Passover Matthew 26:2\nThe Law John 7:19\nThe Commandments Matthew 19:7-9\nThe Jewish law of divorce Matthew 19:7-9\nThe burning bush Mark 12:26\nThe story of Jonah and the great fish Matthew 12:40\nThe glory of Solomon Matthew 6:29\nThe wisdom of Solomon Matthew 12:42\nThe Feast of Tabernacles John 7\nThe eating of the showbread by David Matthew 12:3-4\nThe heavens shut up in the days of Elijah Luke 4:25\nThe healing of Naaman the leper Luke 4:27\nThe record of the brazen serpent John 3:14-15\nThe murders of Abel and Zachariah Matthew 23:35\nThe mission of the Messiah Luke 4:16-21\nThe mission of John the Baptist Matthew 17:10-13\nThe mission of Elijah Matthew 17:10-13\n\n2. The Bible is a unique revelation of truth: The Bible reveals truths\nabout God and humanity that could never be discovered any other way but\nthrough the Bible. It is uniquely human for individuals to ponder their exis-\ntence, origins and destiny. Questions of immortality, heaven, hell, judgment\nand eternity have filled the minds of individuals throughout the ages. These\nquestions remain unanswerable apart from the divine revelation of the Bible.\nNo humanly authored document can reveal or has ever revealed a god such\nas the God of the Bible. Pentecostals believe the Bible is the complete source\nof essential information about God. The Bible demonstrates most clearly and\nauthoritatively God\u2019s works, characteristics and desires for humanity. In the\nScripture, God reveals Himself through true epic stories, historical occur-\nrences, instructive speeches, parabolic teachings and prophetic discourses.\nUltimately, through the Bible, we discover a message of love, grace and sal-\nvation rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ. In one sense, the Bible is a con-\nversation between God and His children. In another sense, it is the divine\nschematic for living a life that is both fulfilled and fulfilling in Christ. The\nBible is dependable, reliable and inspired. As a revelation of the truth, it is\nunequaled in all of human history.\n3. The Bible is an unchanging revelation: Philosophers, religious lead-\ners, scientists and even some Christian theologians have at times challenged\nthe veracity of Scripture, yet the Bible continues to survive these challenges.\nSome philosophers have called into question the truths of the Word of God\nthrough arguments devaluing or deconstructing the meaning and message\nof the Scripture. Many in the scientific community have adopted theoretical\nperspectives that deny historical accounts in the Bible such as the creation\naccount of Genesis. Even so, scientific research and discoveries in biology,\nanthropology, physics, geology and mathematics have frequently supported\nthe accuracy and legitimacy of the Bible\u2019s content. While the Bible is not a\nscience textbook, science has never specifically disproved the Scripture\u2019s nar-\nrative concerning natural phenomena.10 The Bible is unchanging and irrefut-\nable truth.\n10 An excellent treatment of this position is found in W. Grudem, The Relationship between Scripture and the\nFindings of Modern Science (Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1994) 273-309.\n\n4. The Bible is true both morally and spiritually: The Bible demonstrates\nits utmost meaning in the moral and spiritual realm. Myer Pearlman asserted,\n\u201cIntellectual defenses of the Bible have their place; but after all, the best argu-\nment is the practical one. The Bible has worked. It has influenced civiliza-\ntions, transformed lives, brought light, inspiration and comfort to millions.\nAnd its work continues.\u201d11 Thus the Scripture declares: \u201cFor this reason we\nalso thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God\nwhich you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it\nis in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe\u201d\n(1 Thess. 2:13).\nVI. The Inspiration of the Scripture\nA. The miraculous fact of inspiration\nThe Bible is inerrant and infallible. There are no errors in the origi-\nnal words, phrases and sentences of the Scripture. Even though God used\nimperfect people to bring us the Word, the Bible is in all ways perfect and\ncomplete. Consequently, nothing should ever be removed or added to the\nScripture. God brought us the Bible through the writings of 40 different\nauthors over the span of 1,500 years. Many of these writers never interacted\ndirectly with each other. Even so, their writings are in complete agreement.\nThe perfect agreement and compatibility of their various texts can only be\nrightly explained as a miracle of divine inspiration.\nB. The source of the Bible\u2019s inspiration\n\u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u2026\u201d (2 Tim. 3:16, NIV). The Bible was\nproduced by the creative breath of God. Just as God breathed life into Adam,\nHe also breathed His life into the body of Scripture. Note in 2 Peter 1:21 that\n\u201choly men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.\u201d This verse\nliterally reads: \u201cFor the prophecy was not borne [or brought] by the will of\n11 Myer Pearlman, Knowing the Doctrines of the Bible (Springfield, Mo.: Gospel Publishing House, 1939) 29.\n\nman at any time, but men spoke from God, being borne [or brought] by the\nHoly Spirit.\u201d Warfield added to this concept:\nThe term used here is specific, not to be confused with\nguiding, directing, controlling, or even leading in the\nfull sense of that word. It goes beyond all such terms, in\nassigning the effect produced specifically to the active\nagent. What is \u201cborne\u201d is taken up by the \u201cbearer,\u201d and\nconveyed by the \u201cbearer\u2019s\u201d power, not its own, to the\n\u201cbearer\u2019s\u201d goal, not its own. The men who spoke from\nGod are here declared, therefore, to have been taken up\nby the Holy Spirit and brought by His power to the goal\nof His choosing. The things which they spoke under\nthis operation of the Spirit were, therefore, His things,\nnot theirs.12\nC. Distinguishing inspiration from revelation and illumination\nRevelation is the act by which God directly conveys to people truth not\npreviously known\u2014truth that could not have been known in any other man-\nner. Illumination refers to the influence of the Holy Spirit, common to all\nChristians, which helps them grasp the things of God. Jesus, the Word incar-\nnate, promised spiritual illumination and revelation for all believers (Luke\n10:21). In contrast, inspiration deals with how truth is communicated. The\ninspired writers may not have been fully cognizant of the meaning or impor-\ntance of the Scripture they wrote. However, the Holy Spirit directed and\ninfluenced the writers through inspiration, thus preventing any error of fact\nor doctrine.\nD. Theories of inspiration\n1. Liberal views of inspiration: Many liberal theologians believe the Bible\ncontains a varied admixture of the words of men and the \u201cWord of God.\u201d\nThey believe the Bible contains some revelations that God gave to pious\n12 Warfield, 137.\n\nindividuals. However, they understand this divine revelation to be limited by\nand intermixed with human error and fallibility. In other words, they view\nthe Bible as a religious scrapbook containing stories, legends, genealogies and\nlove poems, which are classified and arranged without particular regard to\nchronology or literary perfection. The greatest problem with this view is that\nit places the determination of truth in the hands of the individuals instead\nof in the authority of the Scripture. Consequently, the truth of Scripture\nbecomes relative to the preferences and biases of each individual. Instead of\nsubmitting to the Scripture as universal truth, individuals force the Scripture\nto submit to their preconceived notions of God and humanity.\n2. Neoorthodox views of inspiration: The following statement summa-\nrizes neo-orthodoxy, or dialectical theology: \u201cThe Bible becomes the Word\nof God.\u201d Two prominent theories are the existential view and the demythol-\nogizing view.\na) The existential view popularized by Barth: Karl Barth taught that\nmany human errors and imperfections exist in the Bible\u2014even in the\nautographs. According to Barth, the Bible becomes the Word of God\nas God personally speaks to an individual through an act of revelation.\nIn this existential experience\u2014crisis encounter\u2014the meaningless words\nand phrases on the page leap from the Bible to speak to people concretely\nand meaningfully. At that \u201cmoment of meaning,\u201d the Bible becomes the\nWord of God to the believer.\nb) The demythologizing view of Bultmann and Neibuhr: According\nto this view, stripping the Bible of religious myth uncovers the real\nmeaning of God\u2019s self-giving love in Christ. It is necessary to look\nthrough and beyond the historical record, with all its myth and error, to\nthe super-historical. Rudolf Bultmann and Reinhold Neibuhr proposed\nthat significant events, such as the fall of man, the crucifixion and the\nresurrection are not necessarily the objects of verifiable and factual his-\ntory. Rather, the Bible becomes a revelation when, by the proper (demy-\nthologizing) interpretation, a person is confronted with absolute love as\nset forth in the \u201cmyth\u201d of God\u2019s selfless love in Christ. This approach\nignores that it is illogical to believe the gospel writers intentionally\n\nprovided inaccurate historical facts in an effort to teach perfect doctrine.\nFurther, it is implausible that God would choose to communicate His\ninfallible words through the falsehoods of biblical authors. Using error\nto teach truth seems inconsistent and contradictory to the very nature\nof God as truth.\n3. Liberal and neo-orthodox views influenced developments concerning\ninspiration: Liberalism and neo-orthodoxy have spawned myriad theolo-\ngies and theories. All of these theological trends have nuanced viewpoints\nconcerning inspiration. Even so, many of these theological theories seem to\nembrace either a human-centered or mystery-centered understanding of the\ninspiration of Scripture.\na) Human-centered understanding of inspiration: Some theolo-\ngians and biblical scholars view God as either unknowable or nonexis-\ntent. Within this worldview, they understand the Bible to be a collection\nof stories that are no more authoritative than any other literary work.\nBelieving God\u2019s influence to be absent or nonexistent, these theories\nplace inspiration solely within the motivations of the human authors.\nb) Mystery-centered understanding of inspiration: Some scholars\nbelieve inspiration is to be accepted as a mysterious truth or unknowable\ntruth. Post-modern thought argues that human understanding of truth\nis relative to individual experience. Consequently, every individual expe-\nriences and understands truth from a different perspective. In this con-\nception of reality, the truth of inspiration is accepted as an agreed upon\nmystery or rejected as an unknowable reality.\n4. The conservative views: While liberal theologians contend the Bible\nmerely contains the Word of God, and neo-orthodox scholars assert the Bible\nbecomes the Word of God in an existential \u201cmoment of meaning,\u201d conserva-\ntive theologians believe the Bible is the Word of God. Within the conserva-\ntive school several different theories exist.\na) The verbal dictation theory: This theory posits that God dictated\nto humans every word of the Bible, including the punctuation. Thus the\n\nBible is a verbatim transcript of God\u2019s voice. This theory is also called\n\u201cmechanical inspiration\u201d or \u201cverbal dictation.\u201d Very few evangelicals sub-\nscribe to the verbal dictation theory of inspiration. A notable weakness\nof this theory is it overlooks the personal writing styles of the divinely\nchosen human author.\nb) The inspired concept theory: Some conservatives believe God\ngave divine thoughts to the authors but allowed the authors to record\nthose divine thoughts in their own words. In this theory, the thoughts\nare inspired but not the words. Sometimes known as \u201cdynamic inspi-\nration,\u201d this theory helps explain the Bible\u2019s human qualities but may\nalso overly minimize the Scripture\u2019s divine nature. While the mechanical\ntheory deifies human aspects of the Bible, the dynamic theory humanizes\ndivine aspects.\nc) The verbal plenary inspiration view: This view holds that all the\nwords written in the Scripture are God-breathed and therefore inspired\n(2 Tim. 3:16). \u201cVerbal\u201d signifies the words while \u201cplenary\u201d means full or\ncomplete. Thus the verbal plenary inspiration view understands every\nsingle word of Scripture to be inspired by God and without error. God\ngave full expression to His thoughts in the words of the biblical record.\nHe guided the choice of the words used within the personality and cul-\ntural context of the writers. Therefore, in some inscrutable manner, the\nBible is the Word of God through the words of men. Inspiration, then,\nis the process whereby Spirit moved men (2 Pet. 1:21) produced Spirit-\nbreathed writings (2 Tim. 3:16, NIV).\nGaussen gives an excellent definition when he writes that inspiration\nis \u201cinexplicable power which the divine Spirit put forth of old on the\nauthors of the Holy Scripture, in order to their guidance even in the\nemployment of the words they used, and to preserve them, alike from all\nerror and from all omission.\u201d13 The means, or process, of inspiration is\na mystery of God\u2019s providence, and the result of this process is a ver-\nbal (the words), plenary (extending to all the parts equally), inerrant\n13 L. Gaussen, Theopneustia (Chicago: The Bible Institute Colportage Association, n.d.), as quoted by\nThiessen, 107.\n\n(errorless) and authoritative record. Of all inspiration theories, verbal\nplenary inspiration best expresses the convictions expressed in this book\nas well as most Pentecostal communities.\nVII. The Symbols of the Scripture\nThe Bible frequently uses symbolic language to teach. The Word of God\nis described symbolically or metaphorically throughout the Scripture. The\nmost apparent references are listed:\nSymbol Scripture\nSeed \u201cHaving been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible,\n1 Peter 1:23 through the word of God which lives and abides forever.\u201d See also\nLuke 8:11.\nWater \u201cThat He might sanctify and cleanse her [the church] with the wash-\nEphesians 5:26 ing of water by the word.\u201d\nLamp and Light \u201cYour word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.\u201d See also\nPsalm 119:105 Proverbs 6:23.\nFire \u201c\u2018Is not My word like fire?\u2019 says the Lord\u2026\u201d See also Jeremiah 20:9.\nJeremiah 23:29\nHammer \u201cIs not my word\u2026like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?\u201d\nJeremiah 23:29\nSword \u201cAnd take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which\nEphesians 6:17 is the word of God.\u201d\nMilk \u201cAs newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may\n1 Peter 2:2 grow thereby\u2026\u201d\nHoney \u201cHow sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to\nPsalm 119:103 my mouth!\u201d\n\nVIII. The Holy Spirit and the Scripture\nInspiration accounts for inerrancy, and inerrancy proves inspiration.\nThis miracle of infallible inspiration is the ministry of the Holy Spirit. All\nSpirit-filled believers have known the miracle of divine inspiration by the\nHoly Spirit but not like that experienced by the writers of Scripture. While\nPentecostals value Spirit-led manifestations, they believe these experiences\nmust be rooted in biblical truth. This is primarily because the Scripture was\nborn out of the work of the Holy Spirit. Throughout Scripture, the manifes-\ntations of God\u2019s Spirit always work in harmony with His Word. The follow-\ning are just a few examples:\nA. 2 Samuel 23:2 \u201cThe Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word was\non my tongue.\u201d\nB. Proverbs 1:23 \u201c... Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my\nwords known to you.\u201d\nC. Isaiah 59:21 \u201c... My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have\nput in your mouth\u2026\u201d\nD. Acts 4:31 \u201c... they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the\nword of God with boldness.\u201d\nE. Ephesians 6:17 \u201c... and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word\nof God\u2026\u201d\nF. 1 Peter 1:12 \u201c... those who have preached the gospel to you by the\nHoly Spirit\u2026\u201d\nA distinctive of Pentecostal faith is the belief that the works and gifts of\nthe Holy Spirit are active in the world today. Even so, believers are to judge\nall manifestations by the Scripture. A person\u2019s claim of a divine revelation is\nnot sufficient in and of itself. Rather, there must be a standard, a final court\nof appeal, by which to judge all purported manifestations of the Spirit. The\nHoly Spirit-inspired written Word is the \u201ccourt of appeal\u201d to which people\nmust go to judge the validity of any spiritual activity. The apostle Peter wrote,\n\n\u201cAnd so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed\nas a light that shines in a dark place\u2026\u201d (2 Pet. 1:19). Those who minister are\nnever so fully \u201cin the Spirit\u201d as when they are ministering in full accord with\nthe clearly revealed teaching of the Bible, the Word of God.\nIX. How the Scripture Came to Us\nThe story of how the Bible came to us in its present form is a long and\nfascinating one. It begins with the original manuscripts, or \u201cautographs.\u201d\nAncient writers penned these works as they were \u201cmoved upon\u201d by the\nHoly Spirit (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20-21). For many years, skeptics claimed\nMoses could not have authored the first part of the Bible because writing\nwas unknown at that time (1500 B.C.). However, archaeologists have since\nproven that writing existed thousands of years before the time of Moses.\nSome Egyptian and Babylonian writings date to 3500 B.C., while Sumerian\nwritings go as far back as 4000 B.C.\nA. Ancient writing surfaces\n1. Stone: Scholars have identified many famous writings in Egypt and\nBabylon inscribed on stone. God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on\ntablets of stone (Exod. 31:18). Other examples are the Moabite Stone (850\nB.C.) and the Siloam Inscription found in Hezekiah\u2019s tunnel by the Pool of\nSiloam (700 B.C.).\n2. Clay: The predominant writing material in Assyria and Babylonia was\nclay. Formed into small wedge-shaped tablets, the clay was baked in an oven\nor dried in the sun. Archaeologists have uncovered thousands of these tablets.\n3. Wood: Ancient peoples used wooden tablets quite extensively. For\nmany centuries these tablets were the common writing surface in Greece.\nSome believe this type of writing material is referred to in Isaiah 30:8 and\nHabakkuk 2:2.\n\n4. Leather: The Jewish Talmud specifically required the copying of\nScriptures on the skins of animals, i.e., leather. Scholars are certain Old\nTestament authors wrote on leather. Skins were sewn together to produce\nrolls of a few feet to over a hundred feet long. An author inscribed the text\nin columns perpendicular to the roll, then wrapped it on one or two sticks.\n5. Papyrus: It is likely the New Testament authors wrote on papyrus since\nit was the most important writing material at that time. Thin sections of\nthe papyrus reed were shaved into strips, soaked in several baths of water,\nthen overlapped to form sheets. Individual sheets were layered crosswise and\nplaced in a press until the layers adhered together. The sheets produced were\nsix to fifteen inches high and three to nine inches wide. Sheets were pasted\ntogether to create a roll, usually averaging about 30 feet long.\n6. Vellum or parchment: Vellum came into prominence through the\nefforts of King Eumenes II of Pergamum (197-158 B.C.). He endeavored\nto build up his library, but the king of Egypt cut off his supply of papyrus.\nSearching for a new type of writing material, he perfected a process for the\ntreatment of skins. The result was vellum or parchment. The terms are now\ninterchangeable, but originally vellum was from the skins of calves and ante-\nlopes while parchment was from the skin of sheep and goats. Fine quality\nleather was produced from these skins and was specially and carefully pre-\npared for writing on both sides. This material was used from several hundred\nyears before Christ until about the fourth century A.D. Almost all known\nmanuscripts were written on vellum.\nB. Writing instruments and materials\n1. Chisels were used for writing on stone.\n2. Styluses made of metal or hard wood were used for writing on\nclay tablets.\n3. Pens for writing on papyrus or vellum were made from hollow stalks of\ncoarse grass or reeds. The maker cut the stalk diagonally with a knife, shaved\n\nit thin on the point and then split the point. In order to keep pens in good\ncondition, scribes carried knives with them, thus, the derivation \u201cpenknife.\u201d\n4. Early inks were made from soot or lampblack and gum diluted with\nwater. The first inks were all black. The Essenes, who wrote the Dead Sea\nScrolls, used burnt lamb bones and oil.\nC. Languages\nThe Bible was originally written in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic\nand Greek. All remain as living languages in some parts of the world today.\n1. Hebrew: Almost all of the 39 books of the Old Testament are in\nHebrew. Originally the writers used block-like capital letters without vowels,\npunctuation marks or spaces between words, sentences or paragraphs. Vowel\npoints were added later (approximately A.D. 500-600) by Masoretic scholars.\n2. Aramaic: Related to Hebrew, Aramaic became the common language\nof Palestine after the Babylonian Captivity (approximately 500 B.C.). Small\nportions of the Old Testament were written in Aramaic: one word in Genesis\n31:47, one verse in Jeremiah 10:11, about six chapters in the book of Daniel\n2:4b-7:28 and several chapters in Ezra (Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26). Aramaic\ncontinued to be the vernacular of Palestine for several centuries, so some\nAramaic words are preserved in the New Testament: Talitha cumi (\u201cLittle\ngirl\u2026arise.\u201d) in Mark 5:41; Ephphatha (\u201cBe opened.\u201d) in Mark 7:34; and\nEli, eli, lama sabachthani (\u201cMy God, My God, why have You forsaken me?\u201d)\nin Matthew 27:46. Jesus also habitually addressed God as Abba (Aramaic\nfor \u201cFather\u201d). Note the influence of this in Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6.\nAnother common Aramaic phrase of early Christians was Maranatha, mean-\ning \u201cO Lord, come\u201d (1 Cor. 16:22).\n3. Greek: Though the spoken language of Jesus was apparently Aramaic,\nNew Testament writers used Koine, the common Greek dialect of the time.\nGreek was the universal language of the first century, making possible the\nspread of the gospel throughout the then-known world.\n\nD. Manuscripts\nIn relation to the Bible, the term \u201cmanuscript\u201d is restricted to copies of\nthe biblical text in the original language. Approximately 4,500 manuscripts\nof the New Testament exist. This number is significant as scholars usually\nrequire only 10 or 20 manuscripts of a classical work to consider it genuine.\nBased on that standard, there is abundant evidence supporting the genuine-\nness of the New Testament writings.\n1. Classifications: Manuscripts are divided into four basic classes.\na) Uncials are manuscripts that are written in capital letters. Most\nof the older manuscripts are uncials. Many older manuscripts are called\nuncials because the authors wrote in large capital letters. Some scholars\nthink the name comes from the Latin word uncialibus, meaning inch.\nApproximately 300 of the New Testament manuscripts are uncials and\napproximately 200 of those are written on vellum.\nb) Cursives are manuscripts written in a cursive or running hand.\nThey were written later than uncials. They date from the 10th to the\n15th centuries A.D. Approximately 4,200 of the New Testament manu-\nscripts are cursives. Probably more would have survived had it not been\nfor Diocletian\u2019s order to destroy them in A.D. 302.\nc) Lectionaries, a special group of manuscripts, are selected passages\nof Scripture designed to be read in public services. Lectionaries were writ-\nten both as uncials and cursives. Most lectionaries are from the Gospels,\nbut some are from Acts and the Epistles. These carefully crafted lection-\naries provide exceptional copies for comparison studies. More than 1,800\nhave been discovered to date.\nd) Other specific discovered manuscripts have played crucial roles\nin the compilation of the Bible. There are many manuscripts besides\nthose listed here, mostly smaller fragments of the Old or New Testament.\nHowever small these remnants may be, each gives testimony to the accu-\nracy of the present scriptures.\n\n2. Sinaitic Manuscript\u2014Codex Aleph: One of the earliest of the uncial\nmanuscripts, the Sinaitic (A.D. 340), was discovered in 1844 at the monas-\ntery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai. Written in Greek, it contains a part of\nthe Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, all of the New Testament\nand about half of the Apocrypha. It also contains the Epistle of Barnabas\nand much of the Shepherd of Hermas. It contains 364\u00bd leaves of excellent\nvellum, 13\u00bd inches wide and 147/8 inches high. Each page has four columns\nabout 2\u00bd inches wide, except the Poetical Books, where there are two wider\ncolumns. Each column has 48 lines. Constantine Tischendorf, a German pro-\nfessor and scholar, discovered the manuscript and was able to salvage 43 pages\nfrom the monks who were using them to light their fires. It was not until 15\nyears later he was able to procure the remaining pages. In 1933 the British\nMuseum purchased the manuscript for 100,000 English pounds. It still\nresides there today. In 1975 researchers discovered a formerly unknown room\nin the monastery of St. Catherine holding 13 more pages of the Sinaiticus.\nAlong with the Vaticanus, scholars consider the Sinaitic one of the two most\nimportant manuscripts in existence. It is the only one containing the com-\nplete New Testament.\n3. Vaticanus Manuscript\u2014Codex B: This famous uncial dates from the\nfourth century (approximately A.D. 325-350). It is in Greek and contains the\nfollowing: the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, the Apocrypha,\n(with the exceptions of the books of Maccabees and the Prayer of Manassas)\nand the New Testament. Genesis 1:1-46; 2 Kings 2:57; 2 Kings 10:13; and\nPsalm 106:27 through Psalm 136:6 are missing from the Old Testament.\nMark 16:9-20; John 7:53-8:11; 1 Timothy; 2 Timothy; Titus; Philemon;\nHebrews 9:15-13:25 and Revelation are missing from the New Testament.\nThis manuscript is located in the Vatican Library in Rome where librarians\nfirst catalogued it in 1481. The Vaticanus Codex B contains 759 leaves, 617\nof the Old Testament and 142 of the New. The pages are 10 inches wide and\n10\u00bd inches high. Each page contains three columns of 42 lines, except the\nPoetical Books which have two columns. While considered to have the most\nexact copy of the New Testament known, it is of note that the Vaticanus does\nnot contain Mark 16:9-20. Intriguingly, the scribe left more than a column\nblank at this place as though he knew of these verses but was undecided\nwhether to include them or not.\n\n4. Alexandrian Manuscript\u2014Codex A: This uncial dates back to the\nfifth century (approximately A.D. 450). While it is of both the Old and\nNew Testament, some parts are missing. Missing from the Old Testament\nare Genesis 14:14-17; 15:15, 16-19; 16:69; 1 Kings 12:18-14:9; and Psalms\n49:19-79:10. Missing from the New Testament are Matthew 1:12-5:6;\nJohn 6:50-8:52 and 2 Corinthians 4:13-12:6. This manuscript is composed\nof 773 leaves, 639 of the Old Testament and 134 of the New Testament.\nEach page is 10\u00bc inches wide and 12\u00be inches high and has two columns\nof 50 or 51 lines. It was probably written in Alexandria, Egypt and is said to\nhave been presented to the Patriarch of Alexandria, thus the name \u201cCodex\nAlexandrinus.\u201d It is now in the National Library of the British Museum in\nLondon. It does not quite measure up to the high standard of the Vatican and\nthe Sinaitic Manuscripts.\n5. Ephraem Manuscript\u2014Codex C: This contains portions of both\nthe Old and New Testament. There are now only 64 leaves of the Old\nTestament and 145 leaves of the New Testament. The pages are 9\u00bd by 12\u00bc\ninches. Each page has one wide column of 40-46 (usually 41) lines. It is\nthought to have been written in Egypt, probably Alexandria, and is dated to\nthe fifth century (approximately A.D. 450). This manuscript is a \u201cpalimp-\nsest,\u201d meaning, \u201crubbed out.\u201d Vellum parchment was scarce and expen-\nsive, so at times writers would rub out or erase existing text and inscribe\nnew text. In this case, the writer wrote between the original lines. In the\n12th century, a religious worker partially erased the original writings of this\nmanuscript and inscribed the sermons of the Syriac Father Ephraem (A.D.\n299-378) between the lines. Near the end of the 17th century, a student of\nthe library noticed traces of older writing under the sermons of Ephraem.\nIn 1834, restorers applied a chemical solution and partially revealed the\noriginal writings of the Greek Bible. In 1840, Tischendorf uncovered the\nunderlying text more fully and was the first to read it successfully. In 1843-\n45, he edited and published the manuscript.\n6. Beza Manuscript\u2014Codex D: This dates from the sixth century\n(approximately A.D. 550). With some omissions, it contains the Gospels,\n3 John 11-15 and Acts. It is located in the library at Cambridge University,\nEngland. It is composed of 406 leaves, each 8 by 10 inches, with one column\n\nof 33 lines to a page. This is the oldest known manuscript written in two\nlanguages. The left hand page is in Greek, while the corresponding text in\nLatin is on the right side. In 1562, Theodore Beza14 found it in the monas-\ntery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons, France. In 1581, Beza gave the manuscript to\nCambridge University.\nE. The versions\nA version is a translation from the original language of a manuscript into\nanother language. As the message of Christianity spread beyond Palestine,\ntranslating the Scriptures into other languages became necessary. Compared\nto the manuscripts, translated versions are of secondary value, but they do\nhelp in understanding the meaning of the original text. A few representative\nexamples will be considered.\n1. The Septuagint: This is perhaps the most important of the ver-\nsions because of its early date and its influence on other translations. The\nSeptuagint is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. Begun\nabout 280 B.C. and finished around 180 B.C., it is probably the oldest\nattempt to reproduce a book of any language into another language. It is\nthe oldest existing scriptural document. \u201cSeptuagint\u201d means \u201cseventy\u201d; the\nabbreviation of this version is LXX. An alternative name is the \u201cAlexandrian\nVersion\u201d because the translation work was done in Alexandria, Egypt. This\nnotable work is called the \u201cSeptuagint\u201d because of a legend that 72 scholars\ncame from Palestine (six from each of the 12 tribes of Israel) to Alexandria\nwhere they are said to have completed the work in 72 days. According to\nthe fictitious story, the scholars were isolated from each other and placed\none or two to a room. Later, examiners found that their completed transla-\ntions were identical. Recent research reveals that Alexandrian Jews (rather\nthan Palestinian) performed the work in Alexandria. The Pentateuch rep-\nresents the best of the translation. Other portions of the Old Testament are\nexcellent, but some are more of an interpretation or commentary. In addi-\ntion to the 39 books of the Old Testament, this translation contains much\n14 Beza, a well-known French Bible scholar, went to Geneva, Switzerland and became assistant to, and then\nsuccessor of John Calvin, the famous Protestant reformer.\n\nof the 14 books known as the Apocrypha. The Septuagint, commonly used\nin New Testament times, has been of great use in subsequent translations.\n2. The Samaritan Pentateuch: The Samaritan race came into being after\nthe Assyrians conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 721 B.C. and\ncarried most of the ten tribes into captivity. Sargon, king of the Assyrians,\nsent many idolatrous people from his eastern provinces into Israel (2 Kings\n17:5-6, 24). The Assyrians intermarried with Israelites still in the land\nand thus formed the Samaritan race. The Samaritans set up a rival wor-\nship to the Jews, building a temple on Mount Gerizim. They accepted only\nthe Pentateuch as Holy Scripture. The Samaritan Pentateuch is a Hebrew\nPentateuch written in Samaritan letters. Not a translation, it is actually a\nform of the Hebrew text itself. The date for its writing is about 430 B.C.\nSecond Kings 17:26-28 tells of a priest, from among the Jews taken captive\nin Assyria, sent back to Samaria to teach the people. It is likely he took a\ncopy of the Hebrew Pentateuch with him, ultimately resulting in the cre-\nation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. There are about 6,000 variations from\nthe Hebrew text in this work. Most are of minor importance except where\nthe Samaritans deliberately made alterations to suit their particular beliefs.\nThere are probably around 100 copies of this version in different places in\nEurope and America. The New York Public Library holds the oldest known\ndated manuscript (1232). A Samaritan roll at Nablus (ancient Shechem) in\nIsrael also appears to be very old.\n3. Syriac Version: The Syriac language was the chief language spoken in\nthe regions of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is almost identical to Aramaic.\na) The Old Syriac version was discovered in the mid-19th century; it\ncontains two chief manuscripts:\n(1) Named after its editor William Cureton of the British Museum,\nthe Cureton Syriac is a fifth-century copy of the Gospels, consisting of\n80 leaves.\n\n(2) Discovered at St. Catherine\u2019s Monastery at Mount Sinai, the\nSinaitic Syriac is a palimpsest with only about three-fourths of its writ-\nings decipherable. The date assigned is the fourth or the beginning of the\nfifth century A.D.\nb) The Peshitta, a name that means \u201csimple\u201d or \u201ccommon,\u201d is known\nas the Syriac Vulgate or Authorized Version of the Church of the East.\nIt has been in use since the fifth century A.D. It contains all of the New\nTestament with the exceptions of 2 Peter, 2 John and 3 John, Jude and\nRevelation. There are about 250 manuscripts in existence. It has been a\nvaluable aid to textual criticism and has had a wide circulation, even in\nChina. An English translation was done by George Lamsa.\n4. The Latin versions: It is noteworthy that Latin served as the basis for\nthe first English Bible translation.\na) The Old Latin manuscript dates back as early as A.D. 150. There\nare about 20 copies in existence. It is of primary importance as a witness\nto the genuineness of the biblical text because of its antiquity and its\nfaithfulness to the text.\nb) The Latin Vulgate is the great version of the Bible in the Latin\nlanguage. It is called the Vulgate because it was written in the common\nlanguage of the time. Because of the many mistakes of the copyists of\nthe Old Latin Version, Damasus, Bishop of Rome, secured the services\nof Jerome to produce an authoritative standard revision for the Latin\nspeaking churches. Jerome completed this version in Bethlehem: the\nNew Testament (A.D. 382-383) and the Old Testament (A.D. 390-405).\nJerome\u2019s Vulgate has had tremendous influence on our modern Bible\ntranslations. For more than a thousand years, the Vulgate served as the\nbasis for every Western European translation of the Scripture. Eventually,\nit became the official Bible of the Roman Catholic church as it still is\ntoday. The traditional English version of the Roman Catholic Bible is\na translation of the Vulgate rather than a translation from the original\nGreek language. After the invention of the printing press in 1450, the\nVulgate was the first book ever printed from movable type (1455).\n\nF. Biblical criticism\n1. Higher criticism, also called historical criticism, examines the books of\nthe Bible from the standpoint of their history. Dealing with age, authorship,\ngenuineness and canonical authority, higher criticism looks at the origin,\npreservation and integrity of each biblical book. Higher criticism has helped\nin the ascertaining of a genuine canon of Scripture.\n2. Lower criticism deals with understanding the exact words of the orig-\ninal texts of the Bible. This method gathers and compares ancient manu-\nscripts, versions and quotations of Scripture to determine the true reading of\nevery doubtful passage.\nG. Evidences of biblical text\nThe sincere Bible critic uses the manuscripts, the versions and the writ-\nings of the early church fathers to determine the true wording that is closest\nto the original manuscripts.\n1. The writings of the church fathers: The church fathers were the prom-\ninent leaders, theologians, teachers and scholars during the first few centuries\nafter Christ. They were dedicated Christians who wrote sermons, commen-\ntaries and homilies. They contended for the faith amid the onslaught of false\nreligions. The following are some of the better known names from a group\nsaid to number about 200 individuals during the first seven centuries:\na) A.D. 96-150: Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius and Polycarp\nb) A.D. 150-325: Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria,\nOrigen, Tertullian, Cyprian and Tatian\nc) A.D. 325 and later: Eusebius, Athanasius, Jerome and Augustine\n\nThese men quoted freely from the Bible, citing not only all 27 books of\nthe New Testament but also virtually every verse in those books. Geisler and\nNix asserted, \u201cFive Fathers alone, from Irenaeus to Eusebius, possess almost\n36,000 quotations from the New Testament.\u201d15\nSome years ago, Sir David Dalrymple was at a dinner with a group of\nscholars when the question was asked, \u201cIf the whole New Testament were\ndestroyed in the fourth century, would it be possible for it to be put together\nfrom the writings of the church fathers of the second and third centuries?\u201d\nTwo months later he said to one of the company, \u201cThe question aroused my\ncuriosity, and having all existing works of the Fathers from the second and\nthird centuries, I commenced to search. Up to this time I have found all the\nNew Testament except eleven verses.\u201d The testimony of the writings of the\nchurch fathers to the authenticity of the text is of significant importance.\nFirst, because of their devotion to God and His Word, they were careful in\ntheir copying of the Scriptures. Second, because they lived so close to the\napostolic days, it is probable that they had access to manuscripts not in exis-\ntence today. Some may have had access to the originals.\n2. The Dead Sea Scrolls: In 1947 a Bedouin boy was herding goats near\nthe northern end of the Dead Sea when he discovered these scrolls in a cave.\nApproximately 350 scrolls in all, the Dead Sea Scrolls are considered one of\nthe greatest archaeological finds of the last century. Written by the Essenes\nbetween the first century before and the first century after Christ, the scrip-\ntural portions of the scrolls are hundreds of years older than any other pre-\nviously known manuscripts. Portions of every book of the Old Testament,\nwith the exception of Esther, are contained in the scrolls. Of special inter-\nest is the scroll that contains the entire book of Isaiah. This Hebrew Isaiah\nmanuscript is 1,000 years older than any previously discovered text. Even\nmore remarkably, the scrolls confirm the accuracy of the Masoretic text of the\nOld Testament.\n15 Norman L. Geisler and William E. Nix, A General Introduction to the Bible (Chicago: Moody Press,\n1969) 357.\n\n3. The Papyri: Of great interest to Bible scholars are the papyri found in\nEgyptian graves during the 1900s. Many assert these are the most import-\nant gains for New Testament textual criticism since Tischendorf announced\nthe discovery of the Sinaitic Codes. Sir Arthur Chester Beatty (died 1968)\nacquired the papyri, now housed in the Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland.\nOthers are in the possession of the University of Michigan and private indi-\nviduals. They contain parts of the Old Testament in Greek with considerable\nportions of Genesis, Numbers and Deuteronomy as well as parts of Esther,\nEzekiel and Daniel. Three manuscripts in the group are of New Testament\nbooks. These include portions of 30 leaves of the Gospels and Acts, 86 leaves\nof the Pauline Epistles and 10 leaves out of the middle section of the book\nof Revelation. This material is of great importance for it dates from the third\ncentury or earlier. The text is of such high quality that it ranks with the\nVatican and Sinaitic Codices.\nThe John Rylands Fragment is a papyrus fragment that measures only\n3\u00bd by 2\u00bd inches. Though small, it is the oldest recognized manuscript of any\npart of the New Testament. It was obtained in 1920, has writing on both sides\nand contains portions of the gospel of John (John 18:31-33, 37-38). In 1956,\nVictor Martin, a professor of classical philology at the University of Geneva,\npublished a papyrus codex of the gospel of John called Papyrus Bodmer II.\nThe manuscript contains John 1:1-14:26. Dated A.D. 200, it is probably the\noldest book of the New Testament in substantial condition.\n4. Textual criticism conclusions: Although textual critics have discov-\nered variant readings, none of these have altered Christian doctrine. In fact,\n\u201cWescott and Hort, Ezra Abbot, Philip Schaff, and A.T. Robertson have care-\nfully evaluated the evidence and have concluded that the New Testament text\nis over 99 percent pure.\u201d16\n16 Geisler and Nix, From God to Us, 180.\n\nX. The Scripture in English\nThe beginnings of the English Bible go back to the seventh century when\nan uneducated laborer named Caedmon arranged stories from the Bible in\nverse form. The first English translation was done by Aldhelm, who trans-\nlated Psalms in A.D. 705. The Venerable Bede, an early English historian,\nfinished translating the gospel of John with virtually his last breath (A.D.\n735). Toward the close of the ninth century, King Alfred translated the\nTen Commandments, other laws of the Old Testament, the Psalms and the\nGospels (though these were unfinished at his death). Approximately A.D.\n1000, Aelfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, translated the Gospels, the first\nseven books of the Old Testament, Esther, Job and a part of Kings. The fol-\nlowing are important events related to the development of the English Bible.\nA. John Wycliffe\u2019s translation\nOxford professor, John Wycliffe, with the help of his students, translated\nthe entire Bible into English from the Latin Vulgate. He completed this task\nin 1382. In 1388, John Purvey thoroughly corrected and revised Wycliffe\u2019s\nBible to better harmonize the different styles of the original translators. This\nrevised edition was prominent until the 16th century.\nB. William Tyndale\u2019s translation\nHistorians recognize William Tyndale as the true father of the English\nBible. In 1516, the monk scholar Erasmus published the first printed Greek\nNew Testament. Tyndale sought to translate this Greek version into English.\nHowever, he faced so much opposition from the Roman Catholic church that\nhe had to flee to Hamburg, Germany. From there he finished the translation\nand sought to have it printed in Cologne. By this time, Tyndale had become\nassociated with Martin Luther and the Reformation. Thus, the enemies of the\nReformation became Tyndale\u2019s enemies as well. He was forced to flee from\nCologne with the sheets of his partially printed New Testament.\n\nTyndale found a friendlier environment at Worms, Germany, where he\ncompleted the printing of his translation of the New Testament in 1525.\nEarly the next year, copies of his translation were smuggled into England\nand received with great enthusiasm. However, Roman Catholic authorities\ncondemned the translation as heresy, purchasing and publicly burning all\ncopies found. In the meantime, Tyndale continued his work of translating the\nOld Testament into English. He finished the Pentateuch in 1530, the book\nof Jonah in 1531, and revised Genesis in 1534. Betrayed and imprisoned\nin 1534, Tyndale was strangled and burned at the stake after 16 months in\nprison. His dying words were, \u201cLord, open the King of England\u2019s eyes.\u201d It\nseems that God answered his prayer over the course of time. Both the Great\nBible and the King James Version were approved by the English monarchy\nand are essentially later revisions of Tyndale\u2019s work.\nC. Important 16th and 17th century translations\n1. The Coverdale Bible: In 1535, the Coverdale Bible was printed and\nhas the distinction of being the first complete Bible printed in English. It was\nthe work of Miles Coverdale, a friend of William Tyndale. The Coverdale\nBible was a translation of a translation from the German and Latin. It was the\nfirst Bible to have the approval of the king of England.\n2. Matthew\u2019s Bible: Appearing in 1537, this was the work of William\nTyndale\u2019s friend, John Rogers. It was a combined edition of the work of both\nTyndale and Coverdale. Actually, Matthew\u2019s Bible was Tyndale\u2019s Bible com-\nplete, as far as his translation went, supplemented by Coverdale\u2019s work. It\nwas the first Tyndale revision and formed the basis of all future revisions:\nthe Great Bible, the Geneva Bible, the Bishop\u2019s Bible and the King James\nVersion. It bears the name \u201cMatthew\u2019s Bible,\u201d because Rogers was afraid that\nif Tyndale\u2019s name were attached to it there might be greater opposition to\nits acceptance.\n3. The Great Bible: Published in 1539, the Great Bible was actually a\nrevision of Matthew\u2019s Bible, which was a revision of Tyndale\u2019s. Coverdale, a\nmeticulously careful reviser, did the work. It is known as the \u201cGreat Bible\u201d\nbecause of its large size, 13\u00bc by 7\u00bd inches. It is the first \u201cauthorized\u201d Bible\n\nbecause King Henry VIII officially approved it. He issued a proclamation\nthat it be placed in and read publicly in every church throughout the land\nso that all might have the opportunity to learn from it. Chained to the desk\nof the churches to prevent theft, the Great Bible also became known as the\n\u201cChained Bible.\u201d\n4. The Geneva Bible: Published in Geneva (1560), this was destined to\nbecome the most popular Bible of its century. The publishers printed it in\nsmall size and legible type with appropriate illustrations and commentaries.\nThe Geneva Bible was the first Bible divided entirely into verses. It became\npopular in homes just as the Great Bible had been popular in churches. The\nGeneva Bible was the Bible of Shakespeare and of the Pilgrims who came\nto America.\n5. The Bishop\u2019s Bible: This version was published in 1568 by authority\nof Bishop Parker and other bishops who felt the Geneva Bible undermined\ntheir authority. The Bishop\u2019s Bible was never a popular edition because it was\ntoo cumbersome in size and its language too stiff, formal and difficult for the\ncommon person to understand.\n6. The Rheims Douai Bible: As a result of a flurry of Bible translations by\nthe Protestant church, the Roman Catholic church produced its own English\ntranslation. In 1582, Catholics produced an edition of the New Testament at\nthe English college at Rheims, France. From A.D. 160-910 the Old Testament\nwas produced at the same college, which had moved to Douay, France. Thus,\nthe Rheims Douai Bible became the first Roman Catholic edition of the\nEnglish Bible. It was translated from the Latin Vulgate.\n7. The King James Version: Published in 1611, The King James Version\nis also known as the Authorized Version. At the Hampton Court Conference\n(composed of religious leaders from various and diverse groups called to dis-\ncuss the question of religious tolerance) a proposal was made to produce a new\ntranslation of the Bible. King James received the suggestion with enthusiasm\nand laid down the rule that no divisive comments should be included. About\n48 Greek and Hebrew scholars worked in six groups: two at Westminster,\ntwo at Oxford and two at Cambridge. Each group translated assigned books\n\nand sent the results to the other two groups. Thus, the translation was indeed\nthe work of all rather than any single individual. Actually, it was a revision\nof the Bishop\u2019s Bible, which in turn was a revision of Tyndale\u2019s work. The\nAuthorized Version is the fifth revision of the Tyndale translation. Begun in\n1607, after two years and nine months, it was sent to the printers and was\nfirst presented to the public in 1611, seven years after the convening of the\nHampton Court Conference.\nD. Modern translations\n1. English Revised Edition (ERE): As excellent and popular as it was,\nthe King James Version had certain weaknesses. The most valuable witnesses\nto the original autographs, the Vatican, the Sinaitic, the Alexandrian and\nthe Ephraem Manuscripts were not available to the King James translators.\nMany archaic expressions exist in this translation, and some minor mistakes\nare observable. In February 1870, a motion to consider revising the King\nJames Version passed in the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury.\nUnimpeachable scholars in both England and America engaged in the trans-\nlation work. On May 17, 1881, the New Testament was completed followed\nby the Old Testament on May 19, 1885. The revised work is known as the\nEnglish Revised Edition.\n2. The American Standard Version (ASV): Published in 1901, the\nAmerican Standard Version incorporated an improved textual base beyond\nthat available to the translators of the King James Version. This effort cleared\nmany of the archaic expressions of the King James, yet it was not without crit-\nicism. Though it clarified the understanding of the Greek, it lost the beauty\nof the English.\n3. The Revised Standard Version (RSV): In 1929 the Thomas Nelson\nand Sons publishing company gave the expiring copyright of the American\nStandard Version to the International Council of Religious Education. This\ncouncil appointed a committee of scholars to consider revising the American\nStandard. Funds were difficult to obtain, and it was not until September 30,\n1952 that the entire Bible was completed. The revisers wanted to take advan-\ntage of many new manuscripts and papyri that had been uncovered since the\n\npublication of the 1901 version, yet they wanted to retain the beauty of the\nKing James language. This version has been widely received though has not\nbeen without its critics, chiefly among conservative scholars.\n4. The New American Standard Bible (NASB): Published on July 31,\n1970, the New American Standard Bible has received the endorsement of\nmany conservatives. It is based on the American Standard Version of 1901.\n5. The New International Version (NIV): This completely new transla-\ntion has been enthusiastically received. The New Testament was published in\n1973 and the complete Bible in 1978. The work was done by scholars from\nthe United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; thus,\nit has an international flavor. Scholars from more than thirteen denomina-\ntions participated in the work of translation. The NIV is now the best selling\nEnglish translation in the world having even outsold the King James Bible\nsince 1987.\n6. The New King James Version (NKJV): First released as an entire Bible\nin 1982 by Thomas Nelson, the New King James Version sought to retain the\ndevotional language and intrinsic literary beauty of the 1611 version while\nupdating to modern English. The NKJV enjoys wide popularity throughout\nthe English-speaking world.\n7. Other Translations: Over the past several decades, a flood of new trans-\nlations have endeavored to provide a clearer or more nuanced understanding\nof the Scripture. More translations will most assuredly follow.\nConclusion: Does the abundance of translations and paraphrases indicate\nthat we cannot depend upon our present English Bible to declare the true mes-\nsage of God? Perhaps the following quotation from Sir Frederic Kenyon, direc-\ntor of the British Museum, will answer the question best: \u201cIt is reassuring at the\nend to find that the general result of all these discoveries and all this study is to\nstrengthen the proof of the authenticity of the Scriptures, and our conviction\nthat we have in our hands, in substantial integrity, the veritable Word of God.\u201d17\n17 Sir Frederick Kenyon, The Story of the Bible, 1968.\n\n"};
