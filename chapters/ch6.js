var FOPT_CH6 = {"title": "The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit", "content": "233\nChapter Six\nThe Doctrine of the Holy Spirit\nPneumatology\nINTRODUCTION\nPneumatology is the study of the Holy Spirit. The term pneumatology\ncomes from the Greek words pneuma meaning \u201cSpirit\u201d and logos meaning\n\u201cidea, word, speech, discussion, reason, study.\u201d The following chapter will\nfirst address the overarching role of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christians.\nAfter focusing on these general principles, specific attention will be given\nto the baptism with the Holy Spirit and Spirit-filled ministry. Central to\nPentecostal theology is the conviction that the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nuniquely empowers believers for spiritual service, holy living and deeper inti-\nmacy with God. Therefore, specific focus will be given to examining the role\nof the baptism with the Holy Spirit in the life of believers and the church.\nThe personality, deity, names, symbols and trinitarian implications of the\nHoly Spirit have already been addressed in \u201cChapter Two: The Doctrine of\nGod/Theology.\u201d Consequently, this chapter will expand upon previously dis-\ncussed aspects of the Holy Spirit, giving attention to the work of the Holy\nSpirit, the Holy Spirit as the Helper, the fruit of the Spirit, the baptism with\nthe Holy Spirit, offenses against the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit.\n\nI. The Work of the Holy Spirit\nThe Holy Spirit is God and therefore present wherever God has been\nrevealed. Although the Holy Spirit radically transformed the New Testament\nchurch on the day of Pentecost, the Spirit has always been active in every dis-\npensation of God (Acts 2). God is one; consequently, it is often not possible\nor even necessary for individuals to distinguish the work of the Spirit from\nthe work of the Father and the Son. As a general principle, the Bible seems to\nteach that all divine workings originate with the Father, are carried out by the\nSon and brought to fruition by the Holy Spirit. The following will address\nthe work of the Holy Spirit in relation to the physical universe, the unsaved,\nthe Lord Jesus Christ and the Christian believer.\nA. The Spirit in relation to the world in general\n1. With regard to the material universe\na) The Holy Spirit as an agent in creation: The Bible attributes\nthe creation of all things to each person in the Godhead (Job 33:4; Ps.\n104:30; John 1:3; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:1-2). These various passages are not\ncontradictory, but rather they demonstrate that all three persons of the\nTrinity work together for the accomplishing of the divine will. In fact,\nthe Bible opens with \u201cIn the beginning God created the heaven and the\nearth\u201d (Gen. 1:1), which suggests that the entire Trinity was active in\ncreation, for the word used for God is the Hebrew Elohim, a uni-plural\nword indicating more than one personality.\nb) Three specific acts of creation: In the account of creation, as given\nin Genesis 1:1-27, the Hebrew word bara, which means \u201cto create\u201d or\n\u201cmake out of nothing,\u201d is used three specific times. These three occa-\nsions represent the three great distinctive kingdoms: the heavens and the\nearth (Gen. 1:1), animal life (Gen. 1:21) and human life (Gen. 1:26-27).\nEvolutionists argue that each kingdom is the result of the gradual devel-\nopment of a lower kingdom. In contrast, the Bible emphasizes that each\n\nnew kingdom was made possible only by a special act of creation. The\nHoly Spirit was active in the creation of these three kingdoms:\n(1) The heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:2; Job 26:13; Ps. 33:6)\n(2) Animal life (Ps. 104:11-30)\n(3) Human life (Job 33:4)\n2. With regard to humanity as a whole\na) The Holy Spirit witnesses to the redeeming work of Christ. The\nHoly Spirit bears witness to God\u2019s plan and method of salvation. \u201cThe\nGod of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a\ntree. Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to\ngive repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are His witnesses\nto these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to\nthose who obey Him\u201d (Acts 5:30-32).\nb) The Holy Spirit convicts \u201cthe world of sin, and of righteousness,\nand of judgment\u201d (John 16:8).\n(1) \u201cOf sin, because they do not believe in Me\u201d (John 16:9): Only\nthe Holy Spirit can overcome the blindness and deceitfulness of the sin-\nful human heart to make individuals aware of their personal iniquities.\nNotice that in this passage the Holy Spirit\u2019s conviction is not focused on\nsuch sins as stealing, drunkenness or adultery, but on the sin of unbelief.\nFailure to believe in Jesus Christ is the greatest of all sins, for it is the\nrejection of the means by which all sins are forgiven and all condemna-\ntion is removed.\n(2) \u201cOf righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no\nmore\u201d (John 16:10): The righteousness of which the Spirit convicts is\nChrist\u2019s righteousness. The righteousness of Christ was validated when\n\nHe was raised from the dead and ascended to the Father. When the Father\nexalted Christ to His own right hand, He demonstrated that Christ\u2019s\nsacrifice had paid the full price for all sin. When Christ returned to the\nFather, it was evidence that He had fully completed the task for which\nHe had been sent into the world\u2014the task of providing righteousness for\nthose who believe on Him.\n(3) \u201cOf judgment, because the ruler of this world, Satan, is judged\u201d\n(John 16:11): The greatest demonstration of judgment is that the ruler of\nthis world is judged. \u201cNow is the judgment of this world; now the ruler\nof this world will be cast out\u201d (John 12:31). If Christ judged the ruler of\nthis world, then all who follow him will likewise be judged.\nIt is important for every Christian to realize how this convicting\nministry of the Spirit is accomplished. The Holy Spirit ministers through\nSpirit-filled believers. Jesus told his disciples, \u201cIt is to your advantage\nthat I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you;\nbut if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, He will\nconvict the world of sin\u2026\u201d (John 16:7-8). The Holy Spirit\u2019s role in con-\nviction emphasizes the importance of each believer living a Spirit-filled\nlife. There are also other ways individuals experience the conviction of\nthe Holy Spirit, such as through nature (Rom. 1:20), conscience (Rom.\n1:18-19), Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16-17) and through abiding in a commu-\nnity of Spirit-filled believers (2 Tim. 2:24-26).\nB. The Spirit in relation to Jesus Christ\nOne of the most profound statements of all time is found in the first\nfour words of the Bible: \u201cIn the beginning God\u201d (Gen. 1:1). No explanation\nfor God\u2019s existence is given; no attempt is made to account for His being.\nHumans only understand God as He has chosen to reveal Himself. Jesus\ncame as a further revelation of the Father\u2019s will. Scripture states that \u201cGod,\nwho at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by\nthe prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son\u2026\u201d (Heb. 1:1).\nJesus proclaimed, \u201cHe who has seen Me has seen the Father\u2026\u201d (John 14:9).\nAs the Son reveals the Father, so the Holy Spirit reveals the Son. Jesus told\n\nhis disciples that \u201cHe [the Holy Spirit] will glorify Me, for He will take of\nwhat is Mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine.\nTherefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you\u201d (John 16:14-\n15). In these passages, we see progressive revelation: the Father is revealed by\nthe Son, and the Son is revealed by the Spirit. In the following pages we will\nlook at the role of the Spirit in the ministry of Jesus by examining the work\nof the Holy Spirit in Christ\u2019s person, Christ\u2019s earthly ministry, Christ\u2019s death\nand resurrection, and Christ\u2019s ministry to the church today.\n1. The Spirit and Christ\u2019s person\na) Christ was sent into the world by the Holy Spirit and the Father.\nIsaiah states of Messiah that \u201cI have not spoken in secret from the begin-\nning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord GOD\nand His Spirit Have sent Me\u201d (Isa. 48:16).\nb) Christ was conceived in Mary by the Holy Spirit. The angel\nGabriel told Mary, \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power\nof the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who\nis to be born will be called the Son of God\u201d (Luke 1:35; see also Matt.\n1:18, 20). The conception of Christ in Mary was different from all other\nhuman conceptions. In His earthly conception, the eternal Son did not\nlose His divinity. Rather, through His conception, the Son who had\nexisted eternally became a human being. In His conception, the preex-\nistent Son took on human form, becoming a man. When He took on\nhuman form, He did not diminish His divine nature (Phil 2:6-8). In His\nincarnation Christ was fully God and fully man.\nc) Christ\u2019s reception in the temple was arranged by the Holy Spirit.\nThe Holy Spirit revealed to Simeon \u201c\u2026that he would not see death before\nhe had seen the Lord\u2019s Christ\u201d (Luke 2:26). Led by the Spirit, Simeon\nblessed Jesus as well as Mary and Joseph (Luke 2:27-35). Through this\nencounter, the Holy Spirit fulfilled His promise to Simeon and also wel-\ncomed and blessed the arrival of Jesus in the temple.\n\nd) Christ grew as a human through the working of the Holy Spirit.\nThe Holy Spirit played a crucial role in the physical, intellectual and spir-\nitual growth of Jesus. Luke states that Jesus \u201c\u2026grew and became strong\nin spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him\u201d (Luke\n2:40). Later, Luke mentions, \u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature,\nand in favor with God and men\u201d (Luke 2:52). Jesus was not created an\nadult as Adam was. Instead, He grew and developed as any other child\ngrows except that He did not possess any of the detriments of a sinful\nnature. His development was so rapid and beautiful that at the age of\ntwelve He amazed the teachers in the temple and all others who heard\nHim (Luke 2:47). Jesus\u2019 earthly development in wisdom and understand-\ning was an operation of the Holy Spirit resting upon Him. Isaiah prophe-\nsied concerning Jesus\u2019 development: \u201cThere shall come forth a Rod from\nthe stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow out of his roots. The Spirit of\nthe LORD shall rest upon Him, The Spirit of wisdom and understand-\ning, The Spirit of counsel and might, The Spirit of knowledge and of the\nfear of the LORD\u201d (Isa. 11:1-2). The perfect and complete Godhood of\nChrist did not diminish or grow in His incarnation. Even so, as a human,\nChrist was not omniscient. Rather, His human abilities developed and\nincreased through the Holy Spirit\u2019s power and guidance.\ne) Christ was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted\nby the devil: \u201cThen Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from\nthe Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being tempted\nfor forty days by the devil\u201d (Luke 4:1-2; see also Matt. 4:1; Mark 1:12-13;\nLuke 4:1-13). It is important to note that Jesus was not trapped by the\ndevil. Rather, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the Spirit to meet\nthe devil and face real temptation. Since He faced temptation as a human,\nJesus is able to identify with the temptations humans encounter: \u201cFor we\ndo not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but\nwas in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin\u201d (Heb. 4:15).\n2. The Spirit and Christ\u2019s earthly ministry\nJesus is forever God. Yet in His incarnation He yielded His authority\nto the Father by only ministering through the direction and power of the\n\nHoly Spirit. Jesus began His ministry on earth through being baptized by\nJohn. In His baptism, Jesus visibly demonstrated that His ministry would be\ndone in the power of the Holy Spirit, not in the strength of His own flesh.\nAt His baptism, the Holy Spirit visibly descended upon Jesus (Matt. 3:16-\n17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22). This bestowal of the Holy Spirit officially\nequipped Jesus for public ministry. This is observable in the following aspects\nof Jesus\u2019 ministry:\na) Preaching: Jesus attributed His preaching and teaching to the\nanointing of the Holy Spirit. Quoting the prophet Isaiah, Jesus told the\nsynagogue, \u201cThe Spirit of the LorD is upon Me, because He has anointed\nMe to preach the gospel to the poor\u201d (Luke 4:18).\nb) Healing: Jesus performed mighty healing miracles through the\npower of the Holy Spirit. Peter preached that \u201c\u2026God anointed Jesus of\nNazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power\u2026healing all who were\noppressed by the devil, for God was with Him\u201d (Acts 10:38).\nc) Casting out demons: Jesus cast out demons and confronted the\ndevil through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Pharisees accused Jesus\nof casting out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons (Matt. 12:22-\n30). Jesus showed them the foolishness of Satan casting out himself.\nChrist stated that He \u201ccast out demons by the Spirit of God\u201d as a sign\nthat \u201cthe kingdom of God has come upon you\u201d (Matt. 12:28).\n3. The Spirit and Christ\u2019s death and resurrection\na) Christ was enabled by the Holy Spirit to offer the necessary sacri-\nfice for sins. Hebrews states that if the blood of sacrificed animals \u201csanc-\ntifies for the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of\nChrist, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to\nGod, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\u201d\n(Heb. 9:13-14). The Holy Spirit enabled Jesus to offer a perfect sacri-\nfice in the proper, obedient, loving attitude that was acceptable to God.\nEdwin Palmer wrote:\n\nGod always demands a proper relationship between the\nheart and the overt act\u2026If Jesus had gone to the cross\nunwillingly, sullenly, grudgingly, stoically; and not will-\ningly, with a perfect, ardent zeal, and with faith toward\nthe Father, no atonement could have been made.1\nb) Jesus was raised from the dead by the Holy Spirit. \u201cBut if the Spirit\nof Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised\nChrist from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through\nHis Spirit who dwells in you\u201d (Rom. 8:11). Sometimes the resurrection\nof Jesus is attributed to the Father while other times it is attributed to the\nHoly Spirit (Acts 2:22-24). Regardless, it is clear that resurrection is a\nwork of the Holy Spirit in response to the Father\u2019s will.\n4. The Spirit and Christ\u2019s ministry to the church\na) Christ gave commandments to His apostles through the Holy\nSpirit. Jesus \u201c\u2026through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to\nthe apostles whom He had chosen\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:2). Jesus spoke to his apos-\ntles and still speaks to the church today through the power of the Holy\nSpirit. The church is not dependent upon the bodily presence of the Lord\nto be led by Him. Rather, Jesus leads the church through the presence of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nb) Christ is the giver of the Holy Spirit. On the Day of Pentecost,\nwhen the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the church, Peter said of Jesus,\n\u201cTherefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received\nfrom the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which\nyou now see and hear\u201d (Acts 2:33). This fulfilled what Jesus promised\nHis disciples before His ascension: \u201cBut when the Helper comes, whom I\nshall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from\nthe Father, He will testify of Me\u201d (John 15:26).\n1 Edwin H. Palmer, The Person and Ministry of the Holy Spirit: The Traditional Calvinist Perspective (Grand\nRapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1974) 72.\n\nAlong with purchasing the redemption of all believers through His\ndeath and resurrection, Jesus also baptizes believers with the Holy Spirit.\nJohn the Baptist testified to the importance of Jesus\u2019 role in the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit when he proclaimed, \u201cI indeed baptize you with\nwater unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than\nI, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the\nHoly Spirit and fire\u201d (Matt. 3:11). So vital was the Spirit\u2019s presence in the\nministry of Jesus that it is no wonder Jesus desired for His followers to\ncarry on His work empowered by the same mighty Spirit. Consequently,\nJesus baptizes believers with the Holy Spirit for the purpose of accom-\nplishing His work. This is true New Testament ministry, available for all\nbelievers. Jesus indicated this when He said, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you,\nhe who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater\nworks than these he will do, because I go to My Father\u201d (John 14:12).\nC. The Spirit in relation to believers\nThe Holy Spirit reveals the will of the Father and the Son to and through\nall believers. With this in mind, we will look further at the work of the Spirit\nin relation to the following headings: (1) The Spirit\u2019s work in salvation, (2)\nThe Spirit\u2019s work subsequent to salvation, (3) The Spirit\u2019s work in the min-\nistry and service of the believer and (4) The Spirit\u2019s work in relation to the\nresurrection of the dead.\n1. The Spirit\u2019s work in salvation\na) Believers are born again through the work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus\nsaid to Nicodemus, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of\nwater and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which\nis born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\u201d\n(John 3:5-6). When a person is born naturally, natural life is imparted.\nAdam and Eve lost spiritual life when they sinned. God warned Adam\nand Eve that death would follow their disobedience (Gen. 2:17). As a\nresult of their sin, they were left in spiritual darkness. This subject is dealt\nwith in greater detail in \u201cChapter Five: The Doctrine of Salvation\u201d under\n\u201cVII. Salvation and the Process of Regeneration.\u201d\n\nNew spiritual life is imparted to believers through the indwelling\nHoly Spirit. This is the mark of a Christian. \u201cBut you are not in the\nflesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now\nif anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His\u201d (Rom. 8:9).\nMyer Pearlman wrote: \u201cOne of the most comprehensive definitions of a\nChristian is that he is a man in whom the Holy Spirit dwells. His body is\na temple of the Holy Ghost, in virtue of which experience he is sanctified\nas the Tabernacle was consecrated by Jehovah\u2019s indwelling.\u201d2 Paul wrote,\n\u201cOr do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who\nis in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?\u201d (1 Cor.\n6:19). This is not to be confused with the baptism with the Holy Spirit,\nwhich is an outpouring of the Spirit subsequent to salvation for the pur-\npose of providing power for spiritual service and holy living.\nb) The Holy Spirit bears witness to the believer\u2019s \u201csonship\u201d (Gal.\n3:26): \u201cThe Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are chil-\ndren of God\u2026\u201d (Rom. 8:16). \u201cAnd because you are sons, God has sent\nforth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, \u2018Abba, Father!\u2019\u201d\n(Gal. 4:6). Each of these verses clearly states that it is the Spirit who\ntakes the initiative. The Holy Spirit is the one who bears witness within\nthe heart of the believer. This is more than just an inner feeling; it is the\ndivine witness of a new relationship brought about and testified to by the\nHoly Spirit.\nc) The Holy Spirit baptizes the believer into the body of Christ: \u201cFor\nas the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that\none body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit\nwe were all baptized into one body\u2014whether Jews or Greeks, whether\nslaves or free\u2014and have all been made to drink into one Spirit\u201d (1 Cor.\n12:12-13). In this passage, Paul referred to the process by which individ-\nuals are baptized into Christ\u2019s death and resurrection through the work of\nthe Holy Spirit. Water baptism is an outward symbol of what happens in\nthis process. In the process of salvation, sinners, by faith, die with Christ\non Calvary. Through the work of the Holy Spirit, sinners are brought\n2 Myer Pearlman, Knowing the Doctrines of the Bible (Springfield, MO: The Gospel Publishing House,\n1939) 307.\n\ninto new life and made members of the body of Christ (the church).\nThis is similar to how Paul spoke of Moses and the Israelites: \u201cMoreover,\nbrethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under\nthe cloud, all passed through the sea, all were baptized into Moses in the\ncloud and in the sea\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 10:1-2). Through the Holy Spirit, indi-\nviduals are \u201cbaptized into\u201d Christ\u2019s body.\nIt is important to note the difference between being baptized into\nthe body of Christ and being baptized with the Holy Spirit. Being bap-\ntized into the body of Christ is a work of the Holy Spirit that deals with\nthe believer\u2019s position in Christ. Being baptized with the Holy Spirit is a\nwork of Christ that deals with the believer\u2019s empowerment for ministry\nand holy living.\nd) The Holy Spirit seals the believer: \u201cIn Him you also trusted, after\nyou heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also,\nhaving believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is\nthe guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased\npossession, to the praise of His glory\u201d (Eph. 1:13-14). Paul wrote that\n\u201c\u2026you were sealed for the day of redemption\u201d (Eph. 4:30). When believ-\ners are sealed with the Holy Spirit, God is placing His seal of ownership\nupon them. The presence of the Holy Spirit, indwelling the hearts of\nbelievers, is a sign that every believer belongs to God. The seal of the\nHoly Spirit is also a promise from God to all believers that, through faith\nin Jesus, they will receive their inheritance on the day of redemption.\nPaul wrote, \u201cNevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this\nseal: \u2018The Lord knows those who are His\u2026\u2019\u201d (2 Tim. 2:19).\n2. The Spirit\u2019s work subsequent to salvation\nThe Holy Spirit plays a vital role in the salvation of a soul. Without the\nministry of the Holy Spirit, no one could ever become a child of God. The\nHoly Spirit regenerates the human heart and imparts the life of Christ to\nevery new believer. However, subsequent to salvation, the Holy Spirit still\nplays a vital role in the life of the believer. The Holy Spirit does not leave the\nbeliever but instead seeks to strengthen the believer\u2019s new spiritual life. The\n\nfollowing are ways the Holy Spirit continues to be the active agent of trans-\nformation in the progressive walk of the children of God.\na) Believers are sanctified by the Holy Spirit. As previously men-\ntioned in the study of soteriology, the Holy Spirit plays an integral role\nin the sanctification of the believer. \u201cBut we are bound to give thanks to\nGod always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from\nthe beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit\nand belief in the truth\u2026\u201d (2 Thess. 2:13; see also 1 Pet. 1:2). In sanctifi-\ncation, believers are set apart for the Lord to be continually cleansed from\nsin and progressively conformed to the image of Christ. The world, the\nflesh and the Devil are ever present in the Christian\u2019s daily walk. Just as\na sinner cannot save himself, so a believer cannot live victoriously apart\nfrom the daily strength that the Holy Spirit imparts. Christians will enjoy\nand grow in the gracious ministry of sanctification as they believe God\u2019s\nWord and yield to His Holy Spirit.\nb) Believers are enabled to put to death the deeds of the flesh through\nthe Holy Spirit.\nFor those who live according to the flesh set their minds\non the things of the flesh, but those who live according\nto the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally\nminded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and\npeace\u2026But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if\nindeed the Spirit of God dwells in you\u2026And if Christ is\nin you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is\nlife because of righteousness\u2026Therefore, brethren, we\nare debtors\u2014not to the flesh, to live according to the\nflesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die;\nbut if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the\nbody, you will live (Rom. 8:5-13).\nThe word \u201ccarnal\u201d means \u201cflesh.\u201d This passage clearly states that it\nis impossible to do the will of God while living according to the carnal\nmind. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit who enables believers to die to the\n\nflesh and live victoriously in the Spirit. Believers put to death the deeds\nof their flesh by reckoning their old nature crucified with Christ and by\nchoosing to walk under the guidance and power of the indwelling Holy\nSpirit (Rom. 6).\nc) The Holy Spirit transforms believers into the image of Christ.\nThis is closely associated with the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit\nin transforming the nature of the children of God. \u201cBut we all, with\nunveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being\ntransformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit\nof the Lord\u201d (2 Cor. 3:18). The Weymouth New Testament Bible translates\nthis verse: \u201cAnd all of us, with unveiled faces, reflecting like bright mir-\nrors the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same likeness,\nfrom one degree of radiant holiness to another, even as derived from the\nLord the Spirit.\u201d\nBefore this passage, Paul had been speaking of the fact that Christians\nare epistles of Christ, \u201c\u2026written not with ink but by the Spirit of the\nliving God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the\nheart\u201d (2 Cor. 3:3). Then Paul likened the Christian to a mirror, reflect-\ning the image of the glory of the Lord. He pointed out that Moses\u2019 face\nradiated so brightly from communing with God on Mount Sinai that he\nhad to put a veil on his face because of the brilliant glory (2 Cor. 3:7).\nIn contrast, Paul wrote that believers\u2019 faces are not veiled but open as\nthey reflect the unfading glory of Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 3:16-18). While\nbelievers reflect the glory of the Lord so that others can see it, some-\nthing even more wonderful is taking place within their lives. Through the\noperation of the Holy Spirit, they are being transformed into the same\nimage of Christ that they are endeavoring to reflect. When believers focus\ntheir attention on Jesus, the image of Christ is implanted upon their lives\nthrough the inner ministry of the Holy Spirit.\nd) The Holy Spirit strengthens believers for greater revelations of\nChrist. Paul\u2019s prayer for the Ephesians was:\n\n\u2026that He would grant you, according to the riches\nof His glory, to be strengthened with might through\nHis Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in\nyour hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and\ngrounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all\nthe saints what is the width and length and depth and\nheight\u2014to know the love of Christ which passes knowl-\nedge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God\n(Eph. 3:16-19).\nThese verses confirm what Jesus said concerning the Holy Spirit that\n\u201cHe will glorify me\u201d (John 16:14). Who but the Spirit of God could\nmake Christians able to comprehend such gracious revelations of the per-\nson and nature of God? The Holy Spirit brings revelation to the renewed\nminds of believers so they can \u201c\u2026be filled with all the fullness of God\u201d\n(Eph. 3:19). As the Spirit reveals the things of God, believers are able to\nsee the desirability of embracing those things. In response to this desire,\nbelievers are drawn to reach out in faith to experience the love of God\nthat surpasses knowledge.\ne) The Holy Spirit leads the sons and daughters of God: \u201cFor as\nmany as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God\u201d (Rom.\n8:14). Jesus told His disciples that the Holy Spirit \u201c\u2026will guide you into\nall truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He\nhears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come\u201d (John 16:13).\nOne of the greatest privileges of being a child of the Lord is being led by\nthe omniscient, unerring guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is\na person who personally guides the lives of those who trust His leading\nand care. Not only does He lead the sons and daughters of God, the Holy\nSpirit also enables and empowers believers to walk in the path He has\nchosen for them.\nf) The Holy Spirit performs the office of the Helper. Four times in the\ngospel of John, Jesus spoke of the Holy Spirit as the Helper (John 14:16-\n18, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15). The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in helping\n\nbelievers honor and express the will of God. This will be discussed later in\ndetail in the Ministry of the Holy Spirit as the Helper section.\ng) The Holy Spirit brings forth fruit in the life of every believer. The\nfollowing scriptures are pertinent for understanding the Holy Spirit\u2019s role\nin producing fruitful believers: Romans 14:17; 15:13; 2 Corinthians 6:6;\nGalatians 5:22; Ephesians 5:8-9. This subject is also dealt with later in\nthe fruit of the Spirit section.\n3. The Spirit\u2019s work in the ministry and service of the believer\nThe Holy Spirit imparts and develops spiritual life within Christians.\nThe Spirit also empowers believers for a life of ministry and service in the\nkingdom of God. Scripture frequently demonstrates that God-ordained\nministry and service is accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit rather\nthan merely through human abilities. This is expressed in God\u2019s word to\nZerubbabel: \u201c\u2018\u2026Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u2019 Says the\nLord of hosts\u201d (Zech. 4:6).\na) The Holy Spirit baptizes and endues believers with power for ser-\nvice. After Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission to \u201cGo into\nall the world and preach the gospel to every creature\u201d (Mark 16:15), He\ntold them to \u201c\u2026tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with\npower from on high\u201d (Luke 24:49). This baptism with \u201cthe Holy Spirit\nand fire\u201d (Luke 3:16) demonstrates a new phase in the work of the Holy\nSpirit. Jesus announced this new empowerment before He ascended to\nthe Father: \u201cBut you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come\nupon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea\nand Samaria, and to the end of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:8).\nIt is important to note that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is dis-\ntinct from, and subsequent to, the Holy Spirit\u2019s regenerating work in the\nhearts of the unsaved. The baptism with the Holy Spirit is specifically\nfor believers to have the necessary spiritual power for ministry and holy\nliving. This will later be discussed in detail in Section IV. The Baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit.\n\nb) The Holy Spirit helps believers understand and discern the mean-\ning of Scripture. The Bible is the chief physical tool for every Christian\nworker. The Bible contains God\u2019s perfect revelation to humanity. It\npoints to the means of salvation and gives instructions on how to live\nthe Christian life. One of the most important ministries of the Holy\nSpirit is that He reveals the truth of the Bible to the heart of believers.\nThe Scripture states, \u201c\u2026prophecy never came by the will of man, but\nholy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Pet.\n1:21). The Scripture is Holy-Spirit-inspired prophecy; therefore, the\nHoly Spirit is best able to explain its contents and meaning. Through the\nempowerment of the Holy Spirit, believers have the author of the Bible\nas their own personal teacher and guide. The Holy Spirit not only gives\nunderstanding to the meaning of Scripture but also leads believers to\nexperience the truths of the Bible, making the written word a living word.\nc) The Holy Spirit helps believers pray. Along with studying the\nBible, prayer is one of the chief sources of strength and guidance for\nbelievers. The Holy Spirit is vitally connected with both of these sources\nof Christian empowerment.\n(1) \u201cLikewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not\nknow what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes\nintercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He\nwho searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because\nHe makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God\u201d (Rom.\n8:26-27).\n(2) \u201c\u2026praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 6:18).\n(3) \u201cBut you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith,\npraying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking\nfor the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life\u201d (Jude 20-21).\nThe Spirit\u2019s ministry in prayer is very precious. Praying in the\nstrength and wisdom of the flesh is difficult and trying because it is hard\n\nto exercise faith for things an individual cannot see. It is impossible to\ntruly know how to pray about things that are beyond human under-\nstanding. However, that changes when the Holy Spirit anoints the heart\nand mind of a believer. When the Holy Spirit anoints believers to pray,\nthe presence of God becomes real to them and their minds become open\nto spiritual understanding. Spirit-empowered prayer simplifies faith and\nawakens the believer to the reality of God.\nAs believers are lifted up in the Spirit, spiritual and eternal matters\nbecome more important than temporal matters. The Holy Spirit also\ngives believers wisdom regarding how to petition the Father, constantly\nreminding believers of the promises God has given His children. Often\nthe Holy Spirit enables intercessors to pray in other tongues concern-\ning problems that cannot be understood by the natural mind but only\nthrough prayer \u201cwith the Spirit\u201d (1 Cor. 14:13-15). Praying under the\nanointing and guidance of the Holy Spirit is one of the precious privi-\nleges of Spirit-filled living.\nd) The Holy Spirit gives believers power to preach the word of God.\nPaul testified, \u201cAnd my speech and my preaching were not with persua-\nsive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of\npower\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 2:4). Again he proclaimed, \u201cFor our gospel did not\ncome to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (1\nThess. 1:5). Peter recognized the presence of the Holy Spirit in his preach-\ning as he testified before the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. He declared, \u201cAnd\nwe are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d\n(Acts 5:32). The anointing of the Holy Spirit is crucial for believers to\neffectively preach the gospel. The power of the Holy Spirit is necessary to\nhelp individuals value the things of God and fully realize their spiritual\nneeds. Jesus testified that He was anointed by the Spirit to \u201cpreach the\ngospel\u201d (Luke 4:18-19). If the Spirit\u2019s anointing was necessary for Jesus\nto preach, it most assuredly is necessary for His followers.\nThe signs that follow the preaching of the gospel are important, for\nthey demonstrate the God-given truth of the gospel (Mark 16:20). Even\nso, the power for salvation is not in the accompanying miracles but in the\n\ngospel of Jesus Christ (Rom. 1:16-17). \u201cNow then, we are ambassadors\nfor Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on\nChrist\u2019s behalf, be reconciled to God. For He made Him who knew no\nsin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in\nHim\u201d (2 Cor. 5:20-21). This is the gospel, and God has given believers\nthe Holy Spirit to empower the preaching of this message. Everyone who\nthrills in the signs of Pentecost must never fail to remember that the Holy\nSpirit has been poured out for the primary purpose of saving the lost\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ.\ne) The Holy Spirit gives believers spiritual gifts for ministry to others.\nScripture teaches that spiritual gifts are to be used in spiritual service for\nministry to others (Rom. 12:6-8; 1 Cor. 12:4-11). \u201cBut the manifes-\ntation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all\u2026\u201d (1 Cor.\n12:7). This subject is thoroughly discussed later but is mentioned here to\nshow the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to ministry and service.\n4. The Spirit\u2019s work in relation to the resurrection of the dead\na) The Holy Spirit will raise the bodies of believers in the last day.\n\u201cBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,\nHe who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal\nbodies through His Spirit who dwells in you\u201d (Rom. 8:11). The physi-\ncal body is a definite and important part of humans that is included in\nChrist\u2019s redemption (Rom. 8:23). As Christ was raised from the dead\nand now lives in a glorified body, so each believer who dies in Christ will\nexperience a similar resurrection. This is attributed to the power of the\nindwelling Holy Spirit. Although aspects of this resurrection are a mys-\ntery, the Scripture states that the Holy Spirit will one day \u201cgive life\u201d to\nthe mortal body of every believer. \u201cFor our citizenship is in heaven, from\nwhich we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will\ntransform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body,\naccording to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things\nto Himself\u201d (Phil. 3:20-21).\n\nb) The Holy Spirit strengthens and heals the mortal bodies of\nhumans as a foretaste of their final resurrection (Rom. 8:11). The expres-\nsion \u201cwill also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit\u201d seems\nto also point to the Holy Spirit\u2019s role in strengthening and healing the\nmortal body of the believer. Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026you were sealed with the\nHoly Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the\nredemption of the purchased possession\u2026\u201d (Eph. 1:13-14). The seal of\nthe Holy Spirit is a pledge of the resurrected life to come. Paul spoke of\nthis resurrection life being manifested \u201cin our mortal flesh\u201d (2 Cor. 4:10-\n11). The strengthening and healing of the mortal body is a foretaste of\nthe resurrection life to come.\nII. The Ministry of the Holy Spirit as the Helper\nIn the gospel of John, Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as our \u201cHelper\u201d\n(John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). \u201cHelper\u201d is a powerful name for communi-\ncating the unique work of the Holy Spirit. The Greek word for \u201cHelper\u201d\nis paraclete, meaning one who is called to stand beside for the purpose of\nhelping. Jesus validated the importance of the Holy Spirit\u2019s ministry as the\nHelper when He said, \u201cNevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advan-\ntage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to\nyou; but if I depart, I will send Him to you\u201d (John 16:7). Apparently, Jesus\nconsidered it more important for the Holy Spirit to be present with the\ndisciples than for Him to be bodily present with them. Jesus was geographi-\ncally limited by His incarnation. However, the Helper is not geographically\nlimited and is able to dwell in each believer throughout the world.\nTwo important expressions are used in John 14:16 in regard to the com-\ning of the Helper. First, Jesus spoke of the Holy Spirit as \u201canother Helper.\u201d\nThis word \u201canother\u201d is the key clue to the meaning of the word \u201cHelper.\u201d In\nthis context, the word \u201canother\u201d means another of the same kind. The Holy\nSpirit is not another kind of helper, but another helper in the same manner\nas Jesus. Whatever Jesus was to that little band of disciples, the Holy Spirit\nwould be to them and many others. Jesus said, \u201cI will not leave you orphans;\nI will come to you\u201d (John 14:18). Jesus did not leave His disciples as orphans.\n\nInstead, He gave them the Holy Spirit so that the disciples could know His\nwill and continue to follow His leading. The will of the Father and the Son is\nrevealed to believers through the Holy Spirit.\nJesus ministers the Father\u2019s will to the church through the Holy Spirit.\nThrough the Holy Spirit, believers have relationship with Jesus. Through the\nHoly Spirit, believers can experience the fullness of Christ. This is not to say\nthat Jesus and the Spirit are the same. Rather, just as Jesus was full of the\nSpirit, so is the Spirit\u2019s presence full of Jesus. If the Spirit can dwell in the\nSon, then the Son, in His glorified state, can dwell in the Spirit. Jesus was in\nthe Father, and the Father was in Jesus so that those who saw the Son saw the\nFather. Through the Holy Spirit, we are in Christ, and He is in us. Scripture\nstates, \u201cSo then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was received up\ninto heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went out and\npreached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word\nthrough the accompanying signs\u201d (Mark 16:19-20). Although the Lord is\nin heaven, He is also on earth in the power of the Spirit, working His same\nsigns and miracles. This is possible only because each member of the Trinity\nis omnipresent, and each is present in the others.\nAlong with being \u201canother Helper,\u201d Jesus said the Helper would be sent\n\u201cthat He may abide with you forever.\u201d The promised Helper was given in a\npermanent sense. He abides with the believer forever. As long as there is a\nchurch, there will be a Helper. Therefore, believers should expect that the\nSpirit\u2019s permanence in the church will result in the same works of power and\nblessing in every age. It is through the Spirit that \u201cJesus Christ is the same\nyesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8).\nSome versions translate helper (paraclete) with the word \u201cadvocate.\u201d\nAdvocate seems to be the clear meaning when applied to Jesus: \u201cAnd if any-\none sins, we have an Advocate [paraclete] with the Father, Jesus Christ the\nrighteous\u201d (1 John 2:1). An advocate represents another or pleads the cause\nof another. Scripture points out that the role of advocate is one of the real\nfunctions of the indwelling Holy Spirit: \u201cLikewise the Spirit also helps in our\nweaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but\n\nthe Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be\nuttered\u201d (Rom. 8:26). The Son and the Spirit are both advocates for believers,\nboth making intercession for them. The Spirit intercedes from within the\nbeliever while the Son intercedes at the throne of grace.\nThere is yet another meaning for the word parakletos. The verb form\nof parakletos means \u201cto beseech\u201d or \u201cto exhort.\u201d It is used in Romans 12:1:\n\u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present\nyour bodies a living sacrifice\u2026\u201d The Spirit comforts, encourages, intercedes\nand helps, but He also entreats, exhorts and beseeches. The Holy Spirit is a\npersuader. Without the persuasion of the Holy Spirit, no preaching could\nsucceed, and no sound doctrine could remain uncorrupted. No consideration\nof the Spirit\u2019s work is complete without taking into account His beseeching,\nconvicting and convincing operations.\nEven when all definitions are considered, it is important to realize that\nthe Holy Spirit is more than a definition or a doctrinal distinctive. A. J.\nGordon wrote:\nThe name is the person himself, and only as we know\nthe person can we interpret his name. Why attempt\nto translate this word any more than we do the name\nof Jesus? ...Certain it is that the language of the Holy\nGhost can never be fully understood by an appeal to the\nlexicon. The heart of the church is the best dictionary\nof the Spirit. While all the before-mentioned synonyms\nare correct, neither one is adequate, nor are all together\nsufficient to bring out the full significance of this great\nname, \u201cThe Paraclete.\u201d3\nThe ministry of the Helper is detailed in the following four passages from\nthe gospel of John:\n3 Adoniram Judson Gordon, The Ministry of the Spirit (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1964) 35.\n\n1. \u201cAnd I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that\nHe may abide with you forever\u2014the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot\nreceive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for\nHe dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I will\ncome to you\u201d (John 14:16-18).\n2. \u201cBut the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My\nname, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things\nthat I said to you\u201d (John 14:26).\n3. \u201cBut when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the\nFather, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of\nMe\u201d (John 15:26).\n4. \u201cNevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go\naway; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart,\nI will send Him to you. And when He has come, He will convict the world of\nsin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe\nin Me; of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;\nof judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I still have many things\nto say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the Spirit\nof truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak\non His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell\nyou things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and\ndeclare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that\nHe will take of Mine and declare it to you\u201d (John 16:7-15).\nIn these passages the ministry of the Holy Spirit is divided into four\nphases: He is (1) the believer\u2019s teacher, (2) the believer\u2019s reminder, (3) the one\nwho reveals Jesus and (4) the one who reproves the world.\nA. The Holy Spirit teaches believers\nThe Holy Spirit is \u201cThe Spirit of truth\u201d (John 15:26) who \u201cwill teach you\nall things\u201d (John 14:26).\n\n1. The Holy Spirit guides believers into truth: \u201cHe will guide you into\nall truth\u201d (John 16:13). Half-truth is sometimes worse than ignorance. Christ\ndesires that every believer come to a full knowledge of all divine truth relative\nto redemption and God\u2019s glory.\nThe Holy Spirit guides believers into the truth of Scripture, making the\nteachings of the Bible clear and causing even the most familiar passages to\nradiate new beauty and deeper meaning. The Bible is a spiritual book that\nrequires spiritual discernment (see Acts 8:30-31; 1 Cor. 2:14). Who better\nto guide the reader than the Holy Spirit who first inspired the Bible\u2019s writers?\nBefore the disciples received the infilling of the Holy Spirit, they were\nspiritually ignorant. They failed to comprehend what Jesus meant when He\nreferred to the \u201cleaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees\u201d (Matt. 16:6-11).\nThey could not grasp the meaning of His parables (Mark 4:10). They failed\nto perceive what Jesus referred to when He spoke of the death of Lazarus as\na \u201csleep\u201d (John 11:11-14). They completely missed the truth concerning His\nresurrection (John 20:9).\nHowever, after the Day of Pentecost they were like different men, able to\ngive wonderful expositions of the meaning and application of Old Testament\nscriptures. They were able to fully understand and communicate what\nthe Scripture said concerning Christ\u2019s resurrection (Acts 2:25-31). Before\nPentecost, they could not see that Jesus must suffer, but after Pentecost they\nunderstood the Old Testament prophecies concerning Jesus\u2019 crucifixion (Acts\n4:25-28). Many of the sermons the disciples preached were masterful expo-\nsitions of passages from the Old Testament (Acts 2:16-21; 3:12-26; 7:2-53).\nThrough the infilling of the Holy Spirit, they gained wonderful insight into\nthe truth of Scripture.\n2. The Holy Spirit reveals God\u2019s words and desires: \u201c\u2026when He, the\nSpirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not\nspeak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak\u2026\u201d (John\n16:12-13).\n\na) The Holy Spirit inspired chosen individuals to write the New\nTestament scriptures. Paul declared that he received the marvelous truths\ncontained in his epistles by revelation (Gal. 1:12-16; Eph. 3:3-5). This\nwas accomplished through the ministry of the Helper, the Spirit of truth.\nb) The Holy Spirit speaks to the hearts of Christians, revealing God\u2019s\nunique plan of ministry and service for every believer. For example, the\nSpirit guided Philip to join the Ethiopian eunuch for the purpose of lead-\ning the eunuch to Christ (Acts 8:26-29) and led Paul in regard to where\nhe should minister (Acts 16:6-10).\n3. The Holy Spirit reveals to the believer things that are yet to come: \u201cHe\nwill tell you things to come\u201d (John 16:13).\na) He tells believers of future blessings. In his letter to the\nCorinthians, Paul spoke of the amazing things ahead that God has pre-\npared for His children (1 Cor. 2:9-12). This refers to the fullness of the\nglorious redemption that is in Christ Jesus. Paul declared, \u201cBut God has\nrevealed them to us through His Spirit\u201d (1 Cor. 2:10). In his letter to the\nEphesians, Paul pointed out that there were wondrous spiritual truths in\nrelation to the Lord that believers had not yet grasped. Consequently, he\nprayed that they \u201cmay know\u201d these truths (Eph. 1:17-21). The Helper\ncontinually stirs the heart of each Christian to a greater desire to seek the\nfullness of God.\nb) He reveals dispensational truth. The Holy Spirit will witness to\nwhat lies ahead for the world and the church, making the prophetic\nscriptures clear (Gen. 18:17; Amos 3:7). Even so, no personal revelations\nshould be accepted that are not perfectly in keeping with the teachings\nof Scripture. The Paraclete teaches nothing that is independent from the\nFather and the Son. The Spirit will not reveal anything that is in conflict\nwith the teachings of Christ. All attempts to overrule Christ\u2019s teaching by\nnew revelation are to be rejected. Any teaching that belittles or cheapens\nthe authority of Scripture does not come from the Holy Spirit.\n\nc) He reveals what lies ahead in the pathway of the believer. When\nGod chooses individuals for specific tasks, He brings His call to their hearts\nby the Holy Spirit. Many times He will make known certain aspects of\nwhat is to come to prepare the individual worker for unforeseen eventu-\nalities. Agabus was sent by the Holy Spirit to tell Paul of the dangers that\nlay ahead for him in Jerusalem (Acts 21:10-11). Consequently, Paul and\nhis companions were strengthened and prepared for the coming conflict.\nB. The Holy Spirit reminds believers of His word\nThe Holy Spirit reminds believers of Scripture: \u201c\u2026He will\u2026bring to\nyour remembrance all things that I said to you\u201d (John 14:26). Even though\nhuman memory has suffered as the result of the Fall, believers have a wonder-\nful reminder in the Holy Spirit. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, the\ndisciples were repeatedly reminded of the words of Jesus and the prophetic\nscriptures that confirmed the good news of the gospel. For example, Peter\nmentioned that after the Holy Spirit fell on him, he \u201cremembered the word\nof the Lord\u201d concerning the salvation of the Gentiles and the baptism with\nthe Holy Spirit (Acts 11:15-18).\nThe Holy Spirit reminds believers of the promises, commandments and\ninstructions of Scripture. When Christians are persecuted, the Holy Spirit\nhelps them \u201cRemember the word that I [Jesus] said to you, \u2018A servant is not\ngreater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you\u201d\n(John 15:20). When believers preach or witness to unbelievers, the Holy Spirit\noften brings to remembrance the right scripture for that specific occasion\n(Luke 21:14-15). When facing personal hardship, the Holy Spirit reminds\nbelievers of God\u2019s personal, past promises. When Paul was facing murderous\nthreats while being held captive in the barracks at Jerusalem, the \u201c\u2026Lord\nstood by him and said, \u2018Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified\nfor Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome\u2019\u201d (Acts 23:11).\nThe Holy Spirit assuredly brought this promise to Paul\u2019s remembrance as he\nfaced many seemingly life-threatening trials before finally reaching Rome (see\nActs 27:24-25). The Holy Spirit brings to remembrance the promises of God\nwhen strength and perseverance are needed.\n\nC. The Holy Spirit reveals Jesus\nJesus said that when the Holy Spirit comes, \u201cHe shall testify of me\u201d (John\n15:26) and \u201cHe shall glorify me\u201d (John 16:14). These promises of Christ\nwere certainly fulfilled in the early church, and they continue to be fulfilled\nwhenever the ministry of the Holy Spirit is honored. Wherever the Spirit is\npowerfully moving, Jesus will be powerfully glorified. Through the operation\nof the Holy Spirit there is a three-fold revelation of Jesus Christ.\n1. Christ is revealed to the believer by the Holy Spirit\n\u201cHe will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to\nyou. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take\nof Mine and declare it to you\u201d (John 16:14-15). The Father, the Son and the\nHoly Spirit are one. The Holy Spirit fully knows Jesus. The Holy Spirit has\nbeen with Christ forever and was with Christ throughout His earthly minis-\ntry, even to His sacrifice on the cross. The Holy Spirit reveals the glories of the\nChristian\u2019s heavenly bridegroom.\n2. Christ is revealed in the believer by the Holy Spirit\nThe Holy Spirit seeks to form new believers into Christ\u2019s own image and\nto implant the likeness of Christ within every believer\u2019s heart. Scripture states\nthat believers \u201c\u2026are being transformed into the same image from glory to\nglory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord\u201d (2 Cor. 3:18). Paul spoke of this image\nas Christ \u201cformed in you\u201d (Gal. 4:19). Scripture demonstrates that it is God\u2019s\ngreat pleasure to \u201creveal His Son\u201d in the life of every believer through the\nworking of the Holy Spirit (Gal. 1:15-16).\n3. Christ is revealed through the believer by the Holy Spirit\nThe Holy Spirit never magnifies Himself or the human vessel through\nwhom He operates. Instead, He magnifies the person and ministry of Jesus\nChrist. Jesus said the Holy Spirit \u201c\u2026will not speak on His own authority\u2026\nHe will glorify Me\u2026\u201d (John 16:13-14). Whenever the Holy Spirit is leading,\n\nChrist is exalted. Peter, on the day of Pentecost, full of the Holy Spirit, exalted\nJesus: \u201cTherefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made\nthis Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ\u201d (Acts 2:36). Philip also\nfocused on Jesus when guided by the Holy Spirit: \u201cThen Philip opened his\nmouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him\u201d (Acts 8:35).\nBefore the incarnation of Jesus, God manifested Himself through the Law\nand the Prophets. In the incarnation, Jesus manifested God through yielding\nto the leading of the Holy Spirit. Now, God manifests Himself through the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s revelation of Jesus Christ through human vessels.\nIII. The Fruit of the Spirit\nBelievers who actively follow the leading of the Holy Spirit will manifest\nthe fruit of the Spirit. \u201cBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuf-\nfering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such\nthere is no law\u201d (Gal. 5:22-23). Spirit-filled fruitfulness is available for every\nbeliever who actively surrenders to the leading of the Holy Spirit. \u201cBut now\nhaving been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have\nyour fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life\u201d (Rom. 6:22). The fruit of\nthe Spirit gives evidence to the reality and character of Christ within believ-\ners. Jesus proclaimed this truth to His disciples:\nYou will know them by their fruits. Do men gather\ngrapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? Even so,\nevery good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad\nfruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad\ntree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good\nfruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by\ntheir fruits you will know them (Matt. 7:16-20).\nThe fruit of the Spirit is the true characteristic of the Christian life. The\npsalmist wrote of the \u201cblessed man\u201d that \u201chis delight is in the law of the Lord,\nAnd in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree Planted\nby the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season\u2026\u201d (Ps. 1:2-3).\n\nJeremiah prophesied that there would come a day when God would make\na new covenant with His children and put His \u201c\u2026law in their minds, and\nwrite it on their hearts\u201d (Jer. 31:33). Deuteronomy states that in that day\n\u201c\u2026the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your\ndescendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all\nyour soul, that you may live\u201d (Deut. 30:6). With circumcised hearts, believers\nare able to produce fruit in keeping with righteousness, through the power of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nThe principal purpose of a tree is that it may bring forth fruit. Jesus\ndemonstrated this principle in His reaction to a fruitless fruit tree. \u201cAnd see-\ning a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves,\nand said to it, \u2018Let no fruit grow on you ever again.\u2019 Immediately the fig\ntree withered away\u201d (Matt. 21:18-19). Christ said of the Father that \u201cEvery\nbranch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away, and every branch that\nbears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit\u201d (John 15:2). A life yielded\nto the working of the Holy Spirit will produce fruitfulness in keeping with\nthe character and purposes of Christ.\n\u201cBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kind-\nness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\u201d (Gal. 5:22-23). True\nChristian virtues are the fruit of the Spirit. Believers have the power to bear\nthe fruit of the Spirit when they have the Spirit. Believers bear long-lasting,\nkingdom-advancing fruit when they live in cooperation with the indwelling\nFruit Bearer. The fruit of the Spirit is the character of Christ, produced by\nthe Spirit of Christ, in the follower of Christ. The more individuals are com-\npletely infused with the Spirit\u2019s presence, the more they manifest the fruit of\nthe Spirit in their lives. When believers completely yield and surrender their\nwill to the fullness of the Holy Spirit, they are able to more fully exhibit the\ncharacter of Christ.\nSome endeavor to produce the fruit of the Spirit or the character of\nChrist through human effort alone. They attempt to build character through\nthe exercising of their will and educating their mind. Although education and\nhuman effort have some value, they cannot produce lasting spiritual fruit.\nWhen individuals turn from wickedness and submit to the leading of the\n\nHoly Spirit, Christ-like virtues will be the result: a result as seemingly natural\nas the growing of apples on an apple tree. Attempts founded solely in human\neffort will eventually lead to death: \u201c\u2026but if by the Spirit you put to death\nthe deeds of the body, you will live\u201d (Rom. 8:13). If Christians are devoid of\nspiritual fruit, they are not yielding to the Spirit of Christ.\nIt is important to realize that although the Spirit produces the fruit, it is\nthe result of believers actively partnering with the Spirit\u2019s leading. Abiding\nin the vine is not passive. It requires believers to willingly cooperate with the\nleading and authority of the Holy Spirit. Spirit-given fruit is produced when\nbelievers turn from evil to embrace God\u2019s good purposes for their lives. As\nthe believer submits to the authority of God, through the power of the Holy\nSpirit, the Spirit produces spiritual fruit. Fruitfulness requires both the power\nof the Spirit and the obedience of the believer.\nPaul\u2019s list of the characteristics of the fruit of the Spirit actually summa-\nrizes the heart of the Sermon on the Mount. The fruit of the Spirit is the ideal\nof Christian living in its most concentrated expression. Even the love verses of\n1 Corinthians 13 can be viewed as an extension to Paul\u2019s teachings concern-\ning the fruit of the Spirit. Paul emphasized this fruit of the Spirit principle of\nChristian living when he wrote: \u201cFinally, brethren, whatever things are true,\nwhatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,\nwhatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any\nvirtue and if there is anything praiseworthy\u2014meditate on these things\u201d (Phil.\n4:8). Peter also confirmed this principle of character and fruit bearing when\nhe wrote the following:\nBut also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add\nto your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge\nself-control, to self-control perseverance, to persever-\nance godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to\nbrotherly kindness love. For if these things are yours and\nabound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the\nknowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).\n\nAny concept of spiritual growth that does not recognize the fruit of the\nSpirit as the pattern of Christian character is a false concept. In many ways,\nthe fruit of the Spirit is one of the believer\u2019s greatest treasures, like a golden\nchain with nine precious links of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness,\ngoodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Engraved on this precious\ngift are the sacred words: \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit.\u201d As believers yield to the\nleading of the Holy Spirit, they grow in their appreciation and expression of\nthis sacred gift.\nA. Contrast between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit\nBefore Paul listed the fruit of the Spirit, he addressed the \u201cworks of\nthe flesh.\u201d\nNow the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery,\nfornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred,\ncontentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions,\ndissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and\nthe like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you\nin time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit\nthe kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21).\nThe fruit of the Spirit is manifest; it cannot be hidden. So likewise are the\nworks of the flesh manifested. Spirit-filled people are distinguished by their\nfruit. Those who live according to the flesh are identified by their self-cen-\ntered works. They are not dominated by the indwelling Spirit of God. The\nstruggle in all human personality is a struggle between self and Christ. If the\nself wins, the personality of the individual becomes self-centered. If Christ\nwins, the personality of the believer becomes Christ-centered. The result of\nan egocentric life is the manifestation of the works of the flesh. The result of\na Christ-centered life is the manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit.\nThe principle of fruit bearing is a principle of life. Fruit is not made; it\ngrows. Looking at the contrast between the fruit of the Spirit and the works\nof the flesh in Galatians 5, Samuel Chadwick wrote the following:\n\nThe most striking feature of the contrast is the emphatic\nchange from works to fruit. Works belong to the work-\nshop; fruit belongs to the garden. One comes from the\ningenuity of the factory; the other is the silent growth\nof abounding life. The factory operates with dead stuff;\nthe garden cultivates living forces to their appointed\nend. Works are always in the realm of dead things. Every\nbuilding is built out of dead material. The tree must\ndie before it can be of use to the builder. There is no\nlife in stones and brick, in steel joists and iron girders.\nThey are all dead and in the process of disintegration.\nNothing material lasts. Man\u2019s best works fail and fade,\ncrumble and pass away ... Fruit does not come of man\u2019s\nlabor. It requires his diligence, but it is neither his inven-\ntion nor his product. He does not make the flowers. No\nskill of his brings the golden harvest of the fields, or the\nluscious fruit upon the trees. When man has done all he\ncan, then God begins and life proceeds. Fruit is God\u2019s\nwork. The phrase \u201cfruit of the Spirit\u201d assigns the graces\nof the Christian character to their proper source. They\nare not of man\u2019s producing.4\nThe difference between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit is\nquite apparent. The flesh produces works; the Spirit produces fruit. Chadwick\nreminds us that works of the flesh are the product of the factory; the fruit of\nthe Spirit is of the garden. The works of the flesh are dead; the fruit of the\nSpirit is life.\nB. Ways to bear fruit\n1. Believers bear fruit when they abide in Christ\nIn John 15:1-8, Jesus taught his followers how to bear fruit. Jesus said\nthat anyone who bears no fruit \u201cis cast out as a branch and is withered\u201d (v. 6).\n4 Samuel Chadwick, The Way to Pentecost (New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1937) 102-103.\n\nOthers are described as having \u201cfruit,\u201d \u201cmore fruit,\u201d \u201cmuch fruit\u201d and \u201cfruit\nthat abides.\u201d This principle holds true both in the producing of the fruit of\nthe Spirit and the multiplication of disciples.\nIndividuals bear fruit when they abide in Christ. \u201cAbide in Me, and I\nin you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine,\nneither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches.\nHe who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can\ndo nothing\u201d (John 15:4-5). Fruit bearing is the result of the life of the Vine,\nJesus Christ, flowing through the branch or life of the believer. Jesus said, \u201c\u2026\nwithout Me [lit. \u2018apart from me\u2019 or \u2018separated from me\u2019] you can do nothing\u201d\n(John 15:5). To produce life, the branch must abide in the vine.\nIt is important to realize that the fruit of the Spirit in believers is greatly\nstrengthened by the baptism with the Holy Spirit. All believers have the Holy\nSpirit abiding in them. When believers continue to abide in Christ, they\nexperience a measure of the fruit of the Spirit in their lives. Certainly, those\nwho are baptized with the Spirit, immersed in the Spirit, \u201cfull of the Holy\nSpirit\u201d will experience a greater measure of \u201cmore fruit,\u201d \u201cmuch fruit\u201d and the\n\u201cfruit that remains\u201d in their lives. Even so, the fruit of the Spirit is evident\nwhenever individuals abide in Christ. Consequently believers who have not\nbeen baptized with the Holy Spirit are still able to evidence the fruit of the\nHoly Spirit as they abide in Jesus.\nThe fruit of the Spirit is a result of abiding in Christ. This may explain\nwhy some who have received the baptism with the Holy Spirit seem lacking\nin the fruit of the Spirit. Paul frequently wrote to Christians who had received\nthe Pentecostal anointing yet seemed to be lacking love. His instructions to\nthe Galatians concerning the fruit of the Spirit demonstrate that individuals\nonce full of the Holy Spirit can fall short of producing Spirit-filled fruit. The\nGalatian church had previously experienced the fullness of the Spirit; when\nPaul wrote them, many were not living in that fullness.\nIt is tremendously important for believers to realize the necessity of abid-\ning in Christ. \u201cEvery branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away\u201d\n(John 15:2). This passage refers to Christians. The expression \u201cin Me\u201d shows\n\nthat the branches that are taken away for failure to produce fruit were origi-\nnally true branches in the vine. They were branches, but they did not continue\nin contact with the life-giving vine to bear fruit. Note that it is the branch\nthat is taken away, not the fruit. Jesus said to his followers, \u201cI am the vine,\nyou are the branches\u201d (John 15:5). People who believe Christians cannot lose\nor reject their salvation sometimes argue that God only rejects the \u201cfruit\u201d of\napostates but not the apostates themselves. However, this passage states that\nit is not the fruit that is cast into the fire, but it is the branch that is cast into\nthe fire because it bears no fruit. Abiding in Christ is the sole responsibility of\nthe believer. Fruit is the natural product of abiding. If individuals do not bear\nfruit, they have chosen not to abide in Christ and to separate themselves from\nthe life of the vine. Therefore, they are removed from the vine.\n2. Believers bear fruit when they are pruned\nFruitful branches and fruitful believers are pruned. \u201c\u2026every branch that\nbears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit\u201d (John 15:2). Every branch\nthat does not bear fruit is taken away, but the branch that does bear fruit is\npruned that it might bear even more fruit. The pruning process in the life\nof a sincere Christian is never an easy one. Pruning suggests chastening or\ndisciplining. The author of Hebrews wrote, \u201cNow no chastening seems to\nbe joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the\npeaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it\u201d (Heb.\n12:11). A large, leafy tree may appear beautiful, but trees that are not pruned\nseldom produce much fruit. Sometimes the Lord must cut away some of the\n\u201cleaves\u201d of self-indulgence so that believers might bear \u201cmore fruit,\u201d and even\n\u201cmuch fruit.\u201d Although the process of pruning might appear too painful, the\nbeliever must remember that Jesus said, \u201cMy Father is the vinedresser\u201d (John\n15:1). It is the loving Father who prunes the vine. Therefore, all believers may\nsafely trust themselves to His care.\nC. What does it mean to abide in Christ?\nJesus taught his followers how to abide in Him through using the image\nof the vine and the branches. The branch is an integral part of the vine. The\nbranch grows from the vine and must never be severed from the vine, which\n\nis its source of life. In relationship to the believer, this process represents the\nbeliever\u2019s unbroken fellowship with Christ. First and foremost, this relation-\nship is sustained by believers having unwavering faith in what Christ has\ndone for them and in who they are in Christ. Believers must continually\nrejoice in the saving grace of Jesus Christ and constantly realize that they are\nredeemed, justified and born into the family of God as joint heirs with Christ.\nIn response to these glorious realizations, believers will remain constant in\nthanksgiving, praise, prayer, communion and conscious fellowship with the\nLord. There will be an ever-increasing earnest endeavor in the believer to\nyield to God\u2019s abiding Holy Spirit, to obey His commands and to walk in His\nwill. To abide in Christ believers must \u201clive in the Spirit\u201d (Gal. 5:25), be \u201cled\nof the Spirit\u201d (Gal. 5:18) and \u201cwalk in the Spirit\u201d (Gal. 5:16-25).\nD. The difference between the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit\nIt is important for believers to be aware of the differences between the\nfruit of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. Although they are both expres-\nsions of the Spirit, they are in different categories of spiritual blessing. The\nfollowing are some key differences between the fruit of the Spirit and the gifts\nof the Spirit.\nThe gifts of the Spirit have to do with spiritual capabilities: what people\ndo in the service of the Lord. The fruit of the Spirit has to do with spiritual\ncharacter: who people are in the Lord. The fruit of the Spirit is developed\ngradually as believers abide in Christ and yield to the working of the Holy\nSpirit. In contrast, the gifts of the Spirit are given instantly for the purpose of\nministry. The fruit of the Spirit is the development of the character of Christ,\nwhile the gifts of the Spirit are the impartation of capabilities. Since gifts\nare given for the purpose of ministry assignments, they are not necessarily\na means of judging the depth of a person\u2019s spiritual life. However, fruit does\npoint to the development of spiritual character and maturity. There is one\nfruit of the Spirit but a variety of gifts.\nSpiritual gifts indicate spiritual capabilities imparted by God, while the\nfruit of the Spirit denotes spiritual character developed over time. Outside\nof the gifts of the Spirit, there are many natural gifts and talents people are\n\nendowed with at birth. Human existence and natural capacity are most assur-\nedly gifts from God. Jesus used the parables of the \u201ctalents\u201d to indicate that\nevery person is responsible to serve God with his or her natural talents (Matt.\n25:14-30). Just as individuals do not choose their natural talents, so they\ndo not choose the gifts of the Spirit. The manifestations of the gifts of the\nSpirit are bestowed upon individuals based on God\u2019s divine choosing and the\nministry needs of each individual\u2019s situation and calling. Regardless of their\nvarious giftings, believers are called to abide in Christ and develop the same\nfruit of the Spirit.\nThe manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit seems intricately connected\nwith the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. After being bap-\ntized with the Spirit, the disciples and early church believers seemed to pos-\nsess abilities they did not manifest before being Spirit baptized. Paul spoke of\nthe Holy Spirit \u201c\u2026distributing [gifts] to each one individually as He wills\u201d (1\nCor. 12:11). These gifts seem to be instantly received in a similar manner to\nthe receiving of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On the Day of Pentecost,\nthe Holy Spirit \u201csuddenly\u201d filled those waiting to be baptized. \u201cAnd they were\nall filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the\nSpirit gave them utterance\u201d (Acts 2:4). At one moment they were not able to\nspeak with tongues and the next moment they were. A similar instant occur-\nrence happened in Ephesus: \u201cAnd when Paul had laid hands on them, the\nHoly Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied\u201d\n(Acts 19:6). While gifts of the Spirit come instantly, the fruit of the Spirit is\nthe result of slow, gradual development.\nThere is a tendency among some to view individuals with many gifts\nof the Spirit as though they are super-spiritual individuals. It is important\nto realize that gifts are not, of themselves, the indication of an individual\u2019s\nspiritual depth. Paul indicated that the Corinthian church was full of the gifts\nof the Spirit, and he eagerly desired that they would \u201ccome short in no gift\u201d\n(1 Cor. 1:7). Even so, he spent a large portion of his letters dealing with their\ncarnal spiritual immaturity and lack of Christ-like character (1 Cor. 3:1-4).\nThe Bible has many examples of spiritually immature or disobedient people\npossessing gifts of the Spirit. King Saul was able to prophesy even while rebel-\nling against God\u2019s will (see 1 Sam. 16:14; 19:23-24). The story of Balaam is\n\nalso an example of an individual possessing gifts but having little spiritual\nmaturity (Num. 22-24).\nThere are varieties of gifts, but one fruit of the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians\n12:8-10, Paul listed nine different gifts of the Spirit. Other passages, such as\nRomans 12:6-8, Ephesians 4:11 and 1 Peter 4:10-11 indicate that there may\nbe many more gifts than written in Scripture. In contrast to many gifts, there\nis only one fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5:22-23 does not list eight separate\nfruits but eight separate characteristics of the one fruit of the Spirit. Although\nChristians may receive different spiritual gifts, they should each be known by\nthe same fruit of the Spirit expressed as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,\ngoodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.\nE. The relationship between the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit\nWhile there are definite differences between the gifts and fruit of the\nSpirit, there is also a very vital relationship between them. It is not by\nchance that 1 Corinthians 13 comes right between 1 Corinthians 12 and 1\nCorinthians 14. First Corinthians 12 and 14 deal with the gifts of the Spirit,\nwhile 1 Corinthians 13 is all about love, one of the clear expressions of the\nfruit of the Spirit. This placement emphasizes the importance of having the\nfruit of the Spirit in close relation to the gifts of the Spirit. Paul made it\nvery clear that the gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of love are powerless\nand of little use. In fact, he ultimately argued that the gifts without love are\n\u201cnothing.\u201d\nThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,\nbut have not love, I have become sounding brass or a\nclanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of proph-\necy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and\nthough I have all faith, so that I could remove moun-\ntains, but have not love, I am nothing (1 Cor. 13:1-2).\nLove is at the very essence of the fruit of the Spirit. The gifts of tongues,\nprophecy, wisdom, knowledge and faith mean absolutely nothing without\nthe fruit of the Spirit expressed in love. Therefore, the fruit of the Spirit\n\nmust accompany the use of all spiritual gifts. While Paul emphasized that\nthe gifts have no value outside of the fruit of the Spirit, believers must also\nrecognize that gifts with the fruit of the Spirit have great power and useful-\nness in accomplishing the work of the Lord. The Holy Spirit is concerned\nwith expressing both the character and power of Christ in and through every\nSpirit-filled servant of God.\nF. Detailed characteristics of the fruit of the Spirit\n1. Love: \u201cNow the fruit of the Spirit is love\u201d (Gal. 5:22).\nIt would be impossible to over-emphasize the prominence of this gra-\ncious virtue as the chief characteristic of the Christian life. \u201cBeloved, let us\nlove one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God\nand knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love\u201d\n(1 John 4:7-8). Love is the evidence that one has been born of God. It is not\nonly the inner evidence but also the outer evidence. Jesus said, \u201cBy this all\nwill know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another\u201d (John\n13:35). He also gave His disciples the command: \u201c\u2026Love your enemies, do\ngood to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those\nwho spitefully use you\u201d (Luke 6:27-28). This kind of love cannot be pro-\nduced by human effort. Rather, it must be \u201c\u2026poured out in our hearts by\nthe Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Rom. 5:5). The love that the Spirit produces is some-\nthing more than ordinary, human affection. It comes from a person abiding\nin Christ and experiencing His love. Love is the cement that binds together\nall the other virtues of the fruit of the Spirit into a united whole. It is the\ncommon denominator of all Christian character. A person cannot fully love\nand yet fail to have any of the other virtues. To be filled with the Spirit is to\nbe filled with love.\n2. Joy: \u201c\u2026for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righ-\nteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u201d (Rom. 14:17).\nJoy is love\u2019s reaction to God\u2019s mercies, blessings and benefits. Christian\njoy is not dependent upon circumstances. Joy, which is a facet of love, trusts\nGod even in the most trying circumstances. Human joy looks at the things of\n\nthe earth and is affected by the surrounding conditions. Joy, as an expression\nof the fruit of the Spirit, looks heavenward and is unaffected by surrounding\nconditions, knowing heaven\u2019s benefits are unvarying. Joy accepts various trials\nas divine blessings in disguise. The true Christian life is a joyful life.\nIndividuals who suppress exuberant expressions in Christian worship and\nlabel enthusiasm and rejoicing as inappropriate emotionalism do not have\nan appropriate understanding of Scripture. Not one sentence in Scripture\ncondemns the healthy expression of intense emotions. Joy is natural to\nChristianity. Paul used \u201cjoy\u201d and \u201crejoice\u201d seventeen times in his short epis-\ntle to the Philippians. Emotionless worship is passionless worship. Genuine\nemotion is the result of being inwardly moved. Inappropriate emotionalism\nis the seeking of emotion for emotion\u2019s sake. Christians should be able to\ndistinguish between emotional extravagance and the true operation of the\nHoly Spirit. Even so, Christians full of the Holy Spirit will sing joyfully, pray\nearnestly, preach zealously, testify forcefully and give cheerfully \u201cfor the joy\nof the Lord is your strength\u201d (Neh. 8:10). When the Spirit of God fills an\nindividual, the joy of the Lord will be present, for in His \u201cpresence is fullness\nof joy\u201d (Ps. 16:11).\n3. Peace: \u201c\u2026for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but\nrighteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u201d (Rom. 14:17).\nPeace is deeper and even more constant than joy. Jesus said, \u201cPeace I\nleave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to\nyou. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\u201d (John 14:27).\nPaul said \u201c\u2026the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard\nyour hearts and minds through Christ Jesus\u201d (Phil. 4:7). Peace with God is\nultimately the result of being justified by faith (Rom. 5:1). But peace, as an\nexpression of the fruit of the Spirit, is an inner characteristic that manifests\nitself in peaceableness with others. It signifies freedom from a quarrelsome,\ncontentious or partisan spirit. It seeks to live peaceably with every person.\nAlong with having peace with God, Spirit-filled believers may also have \u201cthe\npeace of God, which surpasses all understanding\u201d (Phil. 4:7) because \u201c\u2026the\nGod of peace shall be with you\u201d (Phil. 4:9).\n\n4. Longsuffering (Patience)\nVirtually all modern translations render the word \u201clongsuffering\u201d as\n\u201cpatience.\u201d Patience is not a very prevalent characteristic of the human spirit.\nHowever, patience is a very special characteristic of God\u2019s love that grows in\nbelievers when they abide in Christ. As previously noted, \u201clongsuffering is\nlove untiring.\u201d It is love persevering through the storm and flood. As believers\nrealize how longsuffering the Lord has been with them, it enables them to be\nmore patient with others. God is patient in calling all to repentance: \u201cThe\nLord\u2026is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that\nall should come to repentance\u201d (2 Pet. 3:9). The psalmist proclaimed \u201cBut\nYou, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and\nabundant in mercy and truth\u201d (Ps. 86:15). Every believer needs the Holy\nSpirit\u2019s help to produce Christ-like patience. The patience of God is crucial\nfor spiritual contentment. James understood the value of patience when he\nwrote: \u201cBut let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and\ncomplete, lacking nothing (Jas. 1:4).\n5. Kindness\nThe Bible frequently uses the word kindness to depict how God deals\nwith His people. The people of God, in turn, bring glory to God as they man-\nifest kindness to each other. Kindness is love expressed to others in response\nto their weaknesses or faults. Kindness is closely associated with every believ-\ner\u2019s need of grace. Paul wrote that God demonstrates \u201c\u2026the exceeding riches\nof His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus\u201d (Eph. 2:7). Sadly,\nunkindness often discredits the ministry of some Christians. When con-\nfronting sin and rebellion, Christians are still called to express kindness. Paul\nclearly instructed the Corinthians that \u201cLove suffers long and is kind\u201d (1 Cor.\n13:4). The ability to proclaim the truth yet demonstrate loving kindness is a\npowerful manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit.\n\n6. Goodness: \u201c\u2026for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteous-\nness, and truth\u2026\u201d (Eph. 5:9).\nThe goodness mentioned references practical, loving acts of goodness\nshown to others. When individuals are truly good at heart, they do good\nto others: \u201cA good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth\ngood \u2026\u201d (Luke 6:45). Goodness is \u201clove in action.\u201d It is love actively doing\ngood to bless and benefits others. Christians do good because they abide in\nthe goodness of Christ. Spirit-filled believers will demonstrate a practical,\nloving goodness that overflows to all people.\n7. Faithfulness\nFaithfulness deals with the character of an individual in relationship to\nothers. J. Lancaster said, \u201cWhile faith in God and His Word is the basis of\nour relationship with Him, and the avenue through which His blessings flow\ninto our lives, what is in view here is the faithfulness of character and conduct\nthat such faith produces.\u201d5 The fruit of a tree is not for the tree but for others.\nConsequently, faithfulness indicates the attitude of believers toward others.\nThere are at least two aspects to faithfulness. The first expression of faith-\nfulness is \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201d In the parable of the talents, the servants who\nvalued and invested their talents were praised for their faithfulness: \u201cWell\ndone, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things\u2026\u201d (Matt.\n25:21, 23). Likewise, those who bear the fruit of loving faithfulness will be\nfaithful to their covenants, promises, duties and obligations. True Christians\nfulfill their responsibilities.\nThe second aspect of faithfulness is \u201ctrustfulness.\u201d In his commentary on\nGalatians, Martin Luther wrote:\nIn listing faith among the fruits of the Spirit, Paul obvi-\nously does not mean faith in Christ, but faith in men.\nSuch faith is not suspicious of people, but believes the\n5 J. Lancaster in Percy S. Brewster, ed., Pentecostal Doctrine (Cheltenham, England: Grenehurst Publishers,\n1976) 71-72.\n\nbest. Naturally the possessor of such faith will be deceived,\nbut he lets it pass. He is ready to believe all men. Where\nthis virtue is lacking, men are suspicious, forward, and\nwayward and will believe nothing, nor yield to anybody.\nNo matter how well a person says or does anything, they\nwill find fault with it, and if you do not humor them, you\ncan never please them. Such faith in people, therefore, is\nquite necessary. What kind of life would this be if one\nperson could not believe another person?\u201d6\nPaul spoke of this faith that believes or trusts others when he wrote that\nlove \u201c\u2026does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things,\nbelieves all things, hopes all things, endures all things\u201d (1 Cor. 13:6-7).\nTrustworthiness and trustfulness are both necessary aspects of faithfulness. A\ntrue Christian will be neither unfaithful nor overly suspicious.\n8. Gentleness: \u201cLet your gentleness be known to all men\u201d (Phil. 4:5).\nJesus said, \u201cTake My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and\nlowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls\u201d (Matt. 11:29). Gentleness is\na calmness of demeanor, a slowness to be angered or take offense. Believers who\nare gentle are not selfishly aggressive. They are not quarrelsome or demanding.\nThey are not argumentative or boastful. Gentleness is not the same as shyness,\ntimidity or weakness. Gentleness is not cowardice or a lack of leadership. Rather,\nindividuals are gentle when they are confident of their worth in Christ. Gentle\npeople do not feel the need to prove their worth by controlling people. Rather\nthan a disqualification for leadership, gentleness is an essential characteristic for\nministry leaders (see 1 Tim. 3:3; 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:24; Tit. 3:2).\n9. Self-Control\nSelf-control is a vital expression of the fruit of the Spirit. Proverbs\nstates, \u201cHe who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules\n6 Martin Luther, Commentary on Galatians, trans. Theodore Graebner (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan\nPublishing House, 1939) 232.\n\nhis spirit than he who takes a city\u201d (Prov. 16:32). True self-control is true\nself-love. Individuals who respect themselves, who consider their bodies\nto be temples of the Holy Spirit, will desire to grow in exercising control\nover their own impulses. True self-control is not just control over food and\ndrink, but over every phase or desire of life. It is control over anger, car-\nnal passions, appetites, desires for worldly pleasures and selfishness. Before\nindividuals can lead a city, community, church or nation, they must first be\nable to rule their own spirit. Paul addressed the importance of self-control\nwhen he wrote the following:\nAll things are lawful for me, but all things are not\nhelpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be\nbrought under the power of any. Foods for the stomach\nand the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both\nit and them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality\nbut for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God\nboth raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His\npower (1 Cor. 6:12-14).\nOr do you not know that your body is the temple of the\nHoly Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God,\nand you are not your own? For you were bought at a\nprice; therefore glorify God in your body and in your\nspirit, which are God\u2019s (1 Cor. 6:19-20).\nIn his concluding remarks concerning the nine graces of the fruit of\nthe Spirit, Samuel Chadwick wrote this beautiful paraphrase of Galatians\n5:22-23:\nIn newspaper English, the passage would read some-\nthing like this: The Fruit of the Spirit is an affectionate,\nlovable disposition, a radiant spirit and a cheerful tem-\nper, a tranquil mind and a quiet manner, a forbearing\npatience in provoking circumstances and with trying\npeople, a sympathetic insight and tactful helpfulness,\n\ngenerous judgment and a big-souled charity, loyalty\nand reliableness under all circumstances, humility that\nforgets self in the joy of others, in all things self-mas-\ntered and self-controlled, which is the final mark\nof perfecting.7\nThe characteristics of the fruit of the Spirit are not imposed upon the\nChristian from without but are the result of the life of Christ within the\nbeliever. Ultimately, the fruit of the Spirit demonstrates the character of Jesus\nChrist in the life of the believer. J. Lancaster explained:\nIn some ways the term \u201cChristlikeness\u201d is inadequate,\nsince the Christian is called, not merely to resemble\nChrist, but to share His very life. With deference to a\ngreat Christian classic, the life of the believer is more\nthan the imitation of Christ; it is becoming \u201ca partaker\nof the divine nature\u201d (2 Pet. 1:4). One might be bold\nenough to suggest that \u201cChristness\u201d would be nearer\nthe mark, since the believer is more than a copy of\nChrist; he is part and parcel of His very being, \u201cbone\nof His bone, flesh of His flesh,\u201d as Paul daringly puts\nit in Ephesians 5:30. Our likeness to Christ is there-\nfore not something applied from without\u2014a cosmetic\ntransformation produced by the formulae of some\nreligious make-up department\u2014but a genuine like-\nness produced by an intimate relationship with Him.\nChrist\u2019s own analogy of the vine and the branches\nupholds this (John 15). The branches are not merely\n\u201cvine-like,\u201d they are part of the vine; likewise the fruit\ndoes not merely resemble grapes, but possesses their\ninherent structure and taste.8\n7 Chadwick, 104.\n8 Lancaster in Brewster, 74-75.\n\nIV. The Baptism with the Holy Spirit\nAfter Jesus rose from the grave and before He ascended to be with the\nFather, He gave His disciples specific instructions to \u201cwait for the promise of\nthe Father\u201d (Acts 1:4) and \u201ctarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued\nwith power from on high\u201d (Luke 24:49). Jesus told His disciples that \u201c\u2026\nJohn truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit\nnot many days from now\u201d (Acts 1:5). Just a few weeks later, on the Day of\nPentecost, Jesus fulfilled His promise to baptize His followers with the Holy\nSpirit. This baptism was responsible for the miraculous growth of the church\nin the apostolic and post-apostolic age. It is also responsible for activating the\ndynamic Pentecostal revival that has swept the world since the turn of the\n20th century. With \u201cat least one quarter of all Christians\u201d worldwide attend-\ning Pentecostal gatherings, Pew research estimates that \u201cWithin Christianity,\nPentecostal and related\u2026Spirit-filled movements are by all accounts among\nthe fastest growing.\u201d9\nIt is not the intent of this work to exalt the empowering ministry of\nthe Holy Spirit above the redemptive work of Christ. As previously men-\ntioned, the principal work of the Holy Spirit is to exalt Christ. Even so, it\nis important to realize that Christ\u2019s finished work has made room for a full-\nness of the Spirit beyond regeneration. This fullness is known as the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit. The greatest promise to the world is \u201c\u2026that whoever\nbelieves in Him [Jesus] should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d (John\n3:16). However, the greatest promise to the church is \u201cBut you shall receive\npower when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses\nto Me\u201d (Acts 1:8). The baptism with the Holy Spirit is of utmost importance\nfor the spiritual life and service of every believer. The baptism with the Holy\nSpirit is the key to the church\u2019s power. Through the baptism with the Spirit,\nindividuals and Spirit-filled communities are able to proclaim and live with\npower the message of the gospel.\n9 The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, Spirit and Power: A 10-Country Survey of Pentecostals (Pew\nResearch Center, October 2006)\n\nThe next sections will deal with the following aspects of the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit: the biblical name used to describe the experience; the\ndefinition, purpose and necessity of the baptism with the Holy Spirit; those\nwho can receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit; the conditions for obtain-\ning the baptism with the Holy Spirit; how to receive the baptism with the\nHoly Spirit; ways the baptism with the Holy Spirit was received in the New\nTestament church; evidences and results of the baptism with the Holy Spirit;\nand additional infillings of the Holy Spirit.\nA. The biblical name\n1. Biblical name: The Scripture uses the term \u201cthe baptism with the Holy\nSpirit\u201d to describe Christian men and women being filled with the fullness\nof the Holy Spirit. Notice the explicit language of the following scriptures:\n\u201cHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire\u201d (Matt. 3:11); \u201cI indeed\nbaptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit\u201d (Mark\n1:8); \u201cFor John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the\nHoly Spirit not many days from now\u201d (Acts 1:5). When dealing with scrip-\ntural truths and experiences, it is important to use scriptural names. It is best\nto refer to the baptism with the Holy Spirit by its biblical name so that indi-\nviduals can fully understand, know and communicate what they are pursuing\nor have received.\n2. Misconceptions\na) Some call the baptism with the Holy Spirit \u201cthe second defi-\nnite work of grace.\u201d However, this expression is not used in the Bible.\nAlthough believers continually grow in God\u2019s grace, the Scripture does\nnot speak of grace as distinct works to be enumerated as second, third,\nfourth, fifth, etc. Although the baptism with the Holy Spirit is certainly\nan expression of God\u2019s grace, it is not biblical to define this experience as\n\u201cthe second definite work of grace.\u201d\nb) Some call the baptism with the Holy Spirit \u201cthe second blessing.\u201d\nThis expression is not used in Scripture. Although God has undoubtedly\na second, as well as many other blessings for His children, Scripture does\n\nnot use \u201cthe second blessing\u201d terminology to describe the outpouring of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nc) Some call the baptism with the Holy Spirit a baptism of \u201csancti-\nfication\u201d or \u201choliness.\u201d Although the baptism with the Holy Spirit plays\na crucial role in helping believers live holy lives, it does not instantly and\ncompletely transform the behavior of Christians. Progressive sanctifica-\ntion and holy living happen over time as believers surrender completely\nto the fullness of the Holy Spirit in their lives. Holy living is developed;\nit is not received as a single gift or blessing.\nWhen individuals fail to identify and call the baptism with the Holy\nSpirit by its scriptural name, they weaken their ability to communicate to\nothers the need for this baptism. When believers use non-biblical terms, they\nconfuse others concerning the blessings, purposes and provisions available in\nthe baptism with the Holy Spirit.\nB. The definition of the baptism with the Holy Spirit\n1. Definition\na) The baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience, sub-\nsequent to salvation, where the Holy Spirit comes upon believers to\nanoint and empower them for spiritual service and holy living. The New\nTestament describes this experience as the Spirit \u201cfalling upon,\u201d \u201ccoming\nupon\u201d or being \u201cpoured out upon\u201d the yielded believer in a sudden and\nsupernatural manner.\nb) The baptism with the Holy Spirit is the promise of the Father:\n\u201cBehold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you\u2026\u201d (Luke 24:49;\nsee also Ezek. 36:27). Before ascending to the Father, Jesus spoke to His\nfollowers and \u201c\u2026commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to\nwait for the Promise of the Father\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:4). The fact that the Father\npromises the indwelling Holy Spirit is a great encouragement to the seek-\ning heart. The baptism with the Holy Spirit is not something believers\n\nmust persuade the Father to give them. Rather, God took the initiative\nand promised the Holy Spirit. The great experience of being baptized\nwith the Holy Spirit did not originate with humans but with God. The\nFather will not forget what He has promised. He is abundantly able to\nfulfill the promise He has given.\nc) The baptism with the Holy Spirit is a gift: \u201cThen Peter said to\nthem, \u2018Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus\nChrist for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy\nSpirit\u2019\u201d (Acts 2:38). Later, Peter and the other apostles proclaimed, \u201cAnd\nwe are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom\nGod has given to those who obey Him\u201d (Acts 5:32). The baptism with\nthe Holy Spirit is a gift. It is free and cannot be worked for, merited or\ndeserved in any manner. Believers do not receive the fullness of the Spirit\nas a reward for hours of prayer or deep sacrifices. Instead, the baptism\nwith the Spirit comes to every believer as a gift of God\u2019s grace to be\nreceived freely.\nd) The baptism with the Holy Spirit is commanded by God: \u201cAnd\nbeing assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart\nfrom Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, \u2018which,\u2019 He\nsaid, \u2018you have heard from Me\u2026\u2019\u201d (Acts 1:4; see also Luke 24:49).\nBelievers should not view the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an optional\nexperience that they can follow or reject based on their own personal\npreferences, rather, it is a commandment of the Lord to be obeyed.\n2. Misconceptions\na) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is the new\nbirth. However, this is not an accurate view. The baptism with the Holy\nSpirit is subsequent to, and distinct from, God\u2019s regenerative work of\nsalvation. A full Christian experience should certainly contain both the\nnew birth and the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Even so, many are genu-\ninely saved who have never been filled with the Spirit. The following facts\nprove this distinction.\n\n(1) The apostles were converted under the ministry of Jesus (Luke\n10:20; John 1:35-50; 13:10-11; 15:3). They were commanded to tarry\nand were filled with the Spirit after their conversion (Luke 24:49; Acts\n1:13-14; 2:1-4).\n(2) The Samaritans were saved under the ministry of Philip (Acts\n8:5-8, 12). They were baptized with the Holy Spirit under the ministry\nof Peter and John some days later (Acts 8:14-17).\n(3) Paul was converted on the road to Damascus through a personal\nvision of the resurrected Christ (Acts 9:3-9). He was baptized with the\nHoly Spirit under the ministry of Ananias three days later (Acts 9:17-19).\n(4) According to Paul\u2019s own words, the twelve men at Ephesus were\nbelievers: \u201cDid you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\u201d (Acts\n19:2). They answered this question by saying, \u201c\u2026We have not so much\nas heard whether there is a Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Acts 19:2). This response\nshows that individuals can be believers but not filled with the Holy Spirit.\nIn response to their lack of understanding concerning the Holy Spirit,\nthe Ephesian believers were baptized in water and received the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit subsequent to the laying on of the apostle\u2019s hands\n(Acts 19:2-7). There does not need to be a long period of time between\nsalvation and the fullness of the Spirit. Even so, the baptism with the\nSpirit is an additional experience to the new birth.\nb) Some wrongly believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit brings\ninstantaneous sanctification. As mentioned under soteriology, sanctifica-\ntion has to do with believers being separated to God and purified for His\nservice. It is two-fold: (1) instantaneous (John 15:3; 1 Cor. 6:11; Heb.\n10:10-14), referring particularly to the believer\u2019s standing in Christ; (2)\nprogressive (1 Thess. 5:23; Heb. 6:1; 12:14), referring to the daily process\nwhere the believer grows in expressing the character and nature of Christ.\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is crucial in the process of progressive\nsanctification. Through the infilling of the Holy Spirit, believers are given\nthe power and direction to live holy lives. However, this sanctification is\n\nnot an instant result of being baptized with the Holy Spirit. Instead, it is\nthe result of Spirit-baptized believers yielding control of their lives to the\nleading and power of the Spirit.\nc) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a reward for\nyears of Christian service or a gift given only to the spiritually mature.\nThey have wrongly adopted the idea that the baptism with the Holy\nSpirit marks them as superior in spirituality and therefore worthy of a\nspecial dispensation from God. On the contrary, the apostle Peter taught\nbelievers that the fullness of the Spirit is immediately available after con-\nversion and water baptism: \u201cThen Peter said to them, \u2018Repent, and let\nevery one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission\nof sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit\u2019\u201d (Acts 2:38). In\nother words, the baptism with the Spirit is available to newly born, spir-\nitually immature, babes in Christ.\nd) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was limited\nto a one-time event in history on the Day of Pentecost. They believe\nChristians should not expect further Holy Spirit baptism experiences\neither individually or collectively. There are many things wrong with\nthis assumption.\nWhen Peter quoted Joel 2:29 he did not say: \u201cNow is fulfilled that\nwhich was spoken by the prophet Joel.\u201d If he had said the prophecy \u201cis\nfulfilled,\u201d there would be nothing more to expect. But what he did say\nwas: \u201cBut this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel\u201d (Acts 2:16). Peter\nspoke of Joel\u2019s prophecy in a way that left an expectation for further,\nsimilar manifestations. Notice the specific wording in Scripture when\na prophecy is finally fulfilled: \u201cAll this was done that it might be ful-\nfilled which was spoken by the prophet\u2026\u201d (Matt. 21:4); \u201cThen they\ncrucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be\nfulfilled which was spoken by the prophet\u2026\u201d (Matt. 27:35). The Day of\nPentecost was not the fulfillment of Joel\u2019s prophecy. Rather, the prophecy\nof Joel was ushered in at Pentecost. There have been many manifestations\nof Joel\u2019s prophecy since that day.\n\nFurthermore, the above-mentioned position is untenable because the\nbook of Acts records at least four other occasions when the Spirit was poured\nout after the Day of Pentecost (Acts 8:14-17; 9:17; 10:44-46; 19:2-7). The\nbaptism with the Holy Spirit was given at the Day of Pentecost for all believ-\ners to receive, just as the gift of eternal life was given for all at Calvary. Even\nso, there must be a definite, individual acceptance and experience of each.\nIf the Spirit had been poured out only at Pentecost, then those 120 or so\nwould have been the only ones who would have received the baptism with\nthe Holy Spirit. Salvation is not by proxy; it is not handed down from one\ngeneration to another, neither is the baptism with the Spirit. Each must be\nreceived individually.\nC. The purpose and necessity of the baptism with the Holy Spirit\n1. Power for witness\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers power for Christian\nservice. Just prior to His ascension, Jesus gave His disciples this great promise:\n\u201cBut you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and\nyou shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and\nto the end of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:8). Power for special service is the distinctive\nresult of having been filled with the Spirit.\nJesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit before He began His public min-\nistry. He also performed His mighty works by the power of the Spirit. He\npreached and healed under the anointing power of the Holy Spirit: \u201cThe\nSpirit of the Lord is upon Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the\ngospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim\nliberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those\nwho are oppressed\u2026\u201d (Luke 4:18). Peter, preaching to Cornelius\u2019 household,\nspoke of \u201c\u2026how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and\nwith power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed\nby the devil, for God was with Him\u201d (Acts 10:38). When confronting the\nPharisees who challenged His authority, Jesus taught that He \u201c\u2026cast out\ndemons by the Spirit of God\u2026\u201d (Matt. 12:28). The Scripture gives many\nexamples of Jesus\u2019 earthly ministry being empowered by the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus promised His disciples that He would send them the Holy Spirit\nafter He returned to the Father so that they could perform greater works\nthrough the power of the Spirit: \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who believes\nin Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will\ndo, because I go to My Father\u201d (John 14:12). The disciples would do greater\nworks in quantity, rather than in quality, as the Holy Spirit would now be\nactively working in all those who yield to the fullness of the Holy Spirit.\nThe disciples were transformed into different men after the Holy Spirit\ncame upon them at Pentecost. In John 20:19, they are portrayed as huddled\ntogether behind closed doors \u201cfor fear of the Jews.\u201d After Pentecost, that\nsame group of men could not be kept behind closed doors (Acts 5:12-20).\nIn fact, in the power of the Holy Spirit the disciples became as bold as lions.\nPeter and John, before the threats of the Sanhedrin, fearlessly proclaimed,\n\u201c\u2026Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to\nGod, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and\nheard\u201d (Acts 4:19-20). The prayers of the disciples demonstrate that they\nfully understood the source of their power for ministry: \u201cNow, Lord, look\non their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may\nspeak Your word\u2026and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they\nspoke the word of God with boldness\u201d (Acts 4:29-31). Stephen\u2019s ministry\nwas empowered by the Spirit: \u201cAnd Stephen, full of faith and power, did\ngreat wonders and signs among the people\u2026And they were not able to resist\nthe wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke\u201d (Acts 6:8, 10). Paul preached\nin the Spirit\u2019s power: \u201cAnd my speech and my preaching were not with per-\nsuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of\npower\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 2:4)\n2. Power to know the will of God\nThrough the baptism with the Holy Spirit, believers have power to dis-\ncern God\u2019s will for their lives. Peter, quoting the prophet Joel, proclaimed:\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out\nof My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your\nyoung men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. And on My\n\nmenservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days;\nAnd they shall prophesy\u201d (Acts 2:17-18).\nThrough the baptism with the Holy Spirit, believers are able to discern\nthe prophetic will of God. Scripture has many examples of the followers of\nChrist being led through prophetic dreams, visions and inclinations. Peter\nwas guided to accept the Gentiles into God\u2019s plan of salvation through a\ndream given by the Spirit of God (Acts 10:9-16). Paul\u2019s missionary journeys\nwere continually influenced by the guidance and leading of the Holy Spirit.\nThe Scripture states that Paul and his companions \u201c\u2026were forbidden by the\nHoly Spirit to preach the word in Asia. After they had come to Mysia, they\ntried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them\u201d (Acts 16:6-7).\nLater, \u201c\u2026a vision appeared to Paul in the night\u2026after he had seen the vision,\nimmediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had\ncalled us to preach the gospel to them\u201d (Acts 16:9-10). It is clear that Paul and\nhis fellow followers of Christ believed that the Holy Spirit empowered them\nto discern the will of God. Believers who are baptized with the Holy Spirit\nwill have greater power to discern and do the will of the Lord.\n3. Power for spiritual warfare\nBelievers have been called to a way of life and to Kingdom tasks that need\nthe fullness of the power of the Holy Spirit. God gives every believer Spirit-\ngiven tasks that require Spirit-given ability. In advancing the purposes of\nChrist, Christian workers face great demonic opposition from the enemy and\nintense conflict in the spiritual realm. Consequently, Christians need spiri-\ntual ability and power to be successful in their work: \u201cFor we do not wrestle\nagainst flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the\nrulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the\nheavenly places\u201d (Eph. 6:12). The Holy Spirit provides spiritual or Spirit-\ngiven weapons to fight the battle: \u201cFor though we walk in the flesh, we do\nnot war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal\nbut mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments\nand every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing\nevery thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 10:3-5).\nThere is no substitute for the power of the Holy Spirit. Those who refuse or\n\nresist the Holy Spirit are helpless, but those who yield to the Holy Spirit find\npower to stand strong \u201c\u2026because He who is in you is greater than he who is\nin the world\u201d (1 John 4:4).\n4. Power for \u201coverflow\u201d\nJesus cried out, \u201c\u2018\u2026If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.\nHe who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow\nrivers of living water.\u2019 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those\nbelieving in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because\nJesus was not yet glorified\u201d (John 7:37-39). Note particularly that the power\nJesus spoke of flows \u201cout of\u201d the believer. It is not enough that the Lord has\nthe power; the individual worker must have it too. God\u2019s servants are more\nthan empty channels; they are vessels. The Lord is looking for individuals\nHe can fill with His presence and power so that they will flow over to others.\nThe ultimate blessing believers bring to others is the overflow of their own\nexperience with God. Ministry is not how much individuals can hold but\nhow much they can overflow.\nNote Paul\u2019s great promise to the Ephesians: \u201cNow to Him who is able\nto do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the\npower that works in us\u201d (Eph. 3:20). What a mighty promise! But notice\nthe closing statement: \u201c\u2026according to the power that works in us.\u201d It is not\nenough that God has all this exceeding, abundant power; the believers must\nhave this power before they can be mightily used of God. Jesus gave His disci-\nples power to heal the sick and to cast out demons (Matt. 10:1). It was God\u2019s\npower, but He bestowed it upon them. Believers today may have this same\npower through the fullness of God\u2019s Holy Spirit.\n5. Power for ability\nPower from on high is \u201cability\u201d from heaven. Power from on high is God-\ngiven ability to do God-given tasks and to carry out God-given commissions.\nIt is the ability to follow divine guidance into fields known only by God. It\nis ability to respond to God\u2019s providence. It is ability to exalt the Lord Jesus\nChrist. It is ability to love divinely as Jesus loved. It is ability to preach Christ\n\nwith conviction and persuasion. It is the ability to exercise spiritual gifts for\nthe edification of the church. It is the ability to suffer persecution for the\nLord\u2019s sake. It is the ability to live a holy life above the wicked standards of\nthe world. Power from on high is ability to work for God: to work lovingly,\nwillingly, faithfully and with perseverance. The baptism with the Holy Spirit\ngives believers the ability to work until Jesus comes or until they complete the\nrace on earth they have been set to run.\nD. Those who can receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit\n1. Recipients: The baptism with the Holy Spirit is available to every\nChristian. It is an experience for every Christian in every age. It is intended\nto be the normal, divine provision for all believers who yield to the fullness of\nthe Holy Spirit in their lives. The baptism with the Holy Spirit is not limited\nto a special class of Christians; rather, it is available to anyone who is willing\nto receive this powerful experience and gift.\n2. Misconceptions\na) Some teach that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is only for those\nwho lived in apostolic days and that the Pentecostal outpouring of the\nSpirit was just for those who lived at that time. This idea is not in keeping\nwith Peter\u2019s words on the day of Pentecost: \u201cRepent, and let every one of\nyou be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and\nyou shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and\nto your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God\nwill call\u201d (Acts 2:38-39). Peter specifically included the next generation\nwith the words \u201cand to your children.\u201d It also seems he was thinking of\nfuture generations when he said, \u201cand to all who are afar off.\u201d Some have\nlimited this promise to a few hundred years. However, the phrase \u201ceven\nas many as the Lord our God shall call\u201d implies that the promise is for\nevery Christian in every age.\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is for God\u2019s church in all ages. As\nlong as the Great Commission is still in effect, binding Christians to the\nduty of worldwide evangelization, there is still a need for the provision of\n\npower to fulfill that commission. As long as God calls believers to holy\nliving, He will also provide the baptism with the Holy Spirit to help them\nlive holy lives. The fullness of the Holy Spirit is needed for the challenges\nand struggles of every age.\nb) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is just for\nministers, missionaries and those in special service for the Lord. This is\ncontrary to the Scripture\u2019s emphasis on the unity of the body of Christ\nand the importance of every member in Christ\u2019s body. The apostle Paul\nemphatically taught that all members of the body have equal importance.\nAnd the eye cannot say to the hand, \u201cI have no need of\nyou\u201d; nor again the head to the feet, \u201cI have no need of\nyou.\u201d No, much rather, those members of the body which\nseem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of\nthe body which we think to be less honorable, on these\nwe bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts\nhave greater modesty, but our presentable parts have no\nneed. But God composed the body, having given greater\nhonor to that part which lacks it, that there should be no\nschism in the body, but that the members should have\nthe same care for one another (1 Cor. 12:21-25).\nEvery Christian has an important role in the church; therefore, every\nbeliever needs the baptism with the Holy Spirit to fulfill his or her spiri-\ntual assignment and follow the leading of God.\nc) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is just for a\nspecial privileged class. However, this is an erroneous assumption. Peter\nlearned that the fullness of the Spirit was for Gentiles as well as Jews\n(Acts 10:34-35, 44-48; 11:15-18). The Lord is no respecter of persons\nand does not play favorites. The gift of the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nis available to all Christians who are willing to receive. Even so, those\nwho have received the baptism with the Holy Spirit should not consider\nthemselves better than others. All of God\u2019s gifts are unmerited grace gifts.\nAll glory for any gift is to be given to God. The reception of the fullness\n\nof the Spirit does not increase the personal prestige of believers, but it\ndoes increase their responsibility. In providing great power, God has the\nright to expect greater service.\nd) Some believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is for mature\nChristians only; they believe that Christians must wait until they are\nmature enough to attain the fullness of the Spirit. However, Scripture\ndemonstrates that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is available to new\nbelievers as well. The Bible has several examples of new believers receiv-\ning the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Samaritan Christians were\nbaptized with the Spirit just a few days after their conversion (Acts 8:14-\n17). Those in the house of Cornelius were filled with the Spirit almost\nimmediately after believing Peter\u2019s message. In fact, it seems Peter\u2019s ser-\nmon was interrupted by the Holy Spirit falling upon them (Acts 10:44-\n46). Christians were taught to expect the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nimmediately after conversion and water baptism (Acts 2:38). It is clear\nfrom Scripture that Spirit-filled fullness is available immediately to any-\none who has experienced the new birth.\nE. Conditions for obtaining the baptism with the Holy Spirit\n1. Repentance from sin\nThe multitude who heard Peter on the Day of Pentecost were cut to the\nheart and said, \u201cMen and brethren, what shall we do?\u201d Peter replied, \u201cRepent,\nand let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remis-\nsion of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Acts 2:37-38).\nPeter\u2019s response demonstrated that repentance is the first step to experiencing\nthe baptism with the Holy Spirit as repentance is also closely tied to the work\nof salvation.\n2. Saving faith\nAn individual\u2019s repentance must be accompanied by saving faith in Jesus\nChrist. Luke 11:13 stresses that it is \u201cyour heavenly Father\u201d who gives \u201cthe\nHoly Spirit to those who ask Him!\u201d The Holy Spirit is the gift of the Father,\n\nand only those who have been saved can call God their \u201cFather.\u201d In fact, the\nSpirit testifies to the truth that God has made us His children: \u201cAnd because\nyou are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying\nout, \u2018Abba, Father!\u2019\u201d (Gal. 4:6).\n3. Water baptism\nAgain, it is important to note Peter\u2019s words to those on the Day of\nPentecost who asked, \u201cMen and brethren, what shall we do?\u201d Peter replied,\n\u201cRepent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for\nthe remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Acts\n2:37-38). The order in Peter\u2019s response seems to be: repentance, regeneration,\nwater baptism and then the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Each step of obedi-\nence opens the way for the next. This is not to say that one who has not been\nbaptized in water could never receive the fullness of the Spirit. However, since\nwater baptism is an act of obedience, it is an important step believers should\ntake to receive the fullness of the Spirit.\nAlthough water baptism is important, Acts records two different times\nwhen the outpouring of the Holy Spirit preceded water baptism. It seems that\nSaul of Tarsus, the apostle Paul, was healed of his blindness and filled with\nthe Spirit as Ananias laid his hands on him in the house of Judas on the street\ncalled Straight. \u201cBrother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the\nroad as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled\nwith the Holy Spirit.\u201d After this we read: \u201cImmediately there fell from his\neyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and\nwas baptized\u201d (Acts 9:17-18).\nAlong with Paul\u2019s conversion, we know that those gathered in the house\nof Cornelius, at Caesarea, believed the word Peter preached and were filled\nwith the Spirit before being baptized in water. Seeing this, Peter said, \u201cCan\nanyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received\nthe Holy Spirit just as we have\u201d (Acts 10:44-48). In both of these cases, the\nHoly Spirit came upon new believers before they had a chance to be bap-\ntized in water. However, after their acceptance of Christ and their Holy Spirit\nbaptism, they were immediately baptized in water. Holy Spirit baptism and\n\nwater baptism are strongly connected in the Scripture. Many have received\nthe baptism with the Holy Spirit as they were brought up out of the waters\nof baptism.\n4. A deep conviction of need\nThere is often a real hunger and thirst for more of God before individu-\nals receive the baptism with the Spirit. Those who seek the baptism with the\nSpirit have a strong awareness of their deep need for God\u2019s empowerment\nand leading. In the baptism with the Spirit, God fulfills this hunger in the\nbeliever. \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they\nshall be filled\u201d (Matt. 5:6). Jesus proclaimed, \u201c\u2018If anyone thirsts, let him come\nto Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his\nheart will flow rivers of living water.\u2019 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit,\nwhom those believing in Him would receive\u2026\u201d (John 7:37-39).\n5. A measure of consecration\nIn seeking the baptism with the Holy Spirit, individuals are ultimately\nyielding their lives to be led and used by God. They are surrendering their\nself-will for the empowering will of God. They are acknowledging their desire\nto be led in the path of God\u2019s choosing. This yielding of the will does not\nmake the believer\u2019s will disappear. At all times, believers are in full possession\nof their will and their faculties. When individuals surrender to God\u2019s will,\nthey are making Christ\u2019s will the center of their lives. God makes the greatest\nuse of individuals willing to yield their will to the direction and control of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nF. How to receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nHow does a believer receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit? This is not\nan easy question to answer because God is not confined to just one method of\nfulfilling His promises, and no two humans are exactly alike in their reception\nof spiritual things. However, there are certain observable, general principles\nthat can serve as a guide to those sincerely seeking the baptism with the Holy\nSpirit. The baptism with the Holy Spirit is received in the following ways:\n\n1. By faith\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is received by faith: \u201c\u2026that we might\nreceive the promise of the Spirit through faith\u201d (Gal. 3:14). Jesus said, \u201c\u2018He\nwho believes in Me\u2026out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.\u2019 But\nthis He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would\nreceive \u2026\u201d (John 7:38-39). The promises of God are received through faith\nin God: \u201cBut without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes\nto God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who dili-\ngently seek Him\u201d (Heb. 11:6). The baptism with the Spirit is not primarily a\nmatter of feelings, signs or evidences. Rather, it is a matter of believing that\nGod will fulfill His promise, that Jesus will baptize every person who ear-\nnestly desires the fullness of the Holy Spirit.\nEven so, it is important not to confuse receiving something by faith\nwith merely hoping for or thinking that you have received it. The bap-\ntism with the Spirit is something individuals truly know they have received.\nConsequently, individuals should keep their hearts open before God with\nan expectant faith until they actually know they have been baptized with\nthe Holy Spirit. When the Spirit comes in His fullness, no one needs to be\ntold that the Spirit is present. Still, believers must keep in mind that the\nSpirit will come as they believe by faith in the promises of God. This faith\noperates in the following ways:\na) Faith in the promise of God\nFaith to receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit is not centered in\nthe individual\u2019s strength, but on the fact that God has promised to give\nthe Holy Spirit, and He will keep His word.\nIf a son asks for bread from any father among you, will\nhe give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he\ngive him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for\nan egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being\nevil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how\n\nmuch more will your heavenly Father give the Holy\nSpirit to those who ask Him! (Luke 11:11-13).\nb) Faith that the promise is for every believer\nIn speaking of the gift of the Holy Spirit, Peter proclaimed, \u201cFor\nthe promise is to you\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:38-39). Jesus said, \u201cFor everyone who\nasks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be\nopened\u201d (Luke 11:10). A general belief in the promise of God is not\nsufficient. There must be a personal appropriation of the promise of the\nSpirit. Believers receive the promise of the Holy Spirit not because of their\nworthiness but because of the worthiness of Jesus to fulfill God\u2019s promise\nfor every believer. God is no respecter of persons; if He has bestowed the\nSpirit on others who are saved by grace, He will also hear and meet the\ncry of each one who comes to Him in sincerity. What the Lord will do for\none of His children, He will do for all who seek Him by faith.\nc) Persistent faith\nJesus told several parables that emphasize the importance of indi-\nviduals having consistent, persistent faith that will not be denied (Luke\n11:5-10; 18:1-8). Receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit marks a\ngreat turning point in the Christian experience. Consequently, the Lord\nmay delay the granting of Spirit baptism to test the motives and desires\nof the seeker\u2019s heart. Many seekers have been the most discouraged just\nbefore the Spirit came in His fullness. Therefore, believers should stand\non God\u2019s promise until it is completely fulfilled.\nd) Faith that is manifest in praise and thanksgiving\nWhen believers realize the greatness of what God has promised\nand what He is about to do, their hearts should rejoice and overflow\nwith thankfulness. Almost invariably, the Holy Spirit comes when an\nindividual is praising the Lord. Praise is a manifestation of faith. Praise\ncan be given to God even when one does not feel like praising God.\n\nThankfulness and praise to God are not to be centered in one\u2019s feelings\nbut in the greatness of God. Regardless of how people feel, God is the\nsame and worthy of adoration.\n2. By fully yielding to the Holy Spirit\nThis is often the most difficult condition to fulfill. After believers real-\nize their need for the baptism with the Spirit and come to the Lord for this\nblessing, they still must yield their entire being to the control of the Spirit.\nHumans generally find it easier to do something themselves rather than\nyield to another to do it for them. John said concerning Jesus, \u201cHe will bap-\ntize you with the Holy Spirit and fire\u201d (Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16).\nWhen the subject of the baptism with the Holy Spirit is mentioned, people\nusually think primarily of the Holy Spirit. However, individuals should\nrealize that this mighty experience is primarily an encounter with the Lord\nJesus Christ.\nPeter confirmed Jesus\u2019 personal association with this Pentecostal experi-\nence when on the day of Pentecost he said, \u201cThis Jesus God has raised up,\nof which we are all witnesses. Therefore being exalted to the right hand of\nGod, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,\nHe poured out this which you now see and hear\u201d (Acts 2:32-33). When\nindividuals receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit, they are yielding to\nChrist. If they reject the Pentecostal experience, they are rejecting a distinct\nministry of Jesus Christ. For there to be a baptism, there must be a baptizer.\nJust as individuals yield completely to the one who is immersing them in\nwater baptism, they must also yield to the One who is baptizing them with\nthe Holy Spirit.\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is a total yielding to the Lord Jesus\nChrist. It brings the recipient into a new and more intimate relationship with\nJesus Christ. This idea of believers completely yielding is perhaps the funda-\nmental thought behind the entire Spirit-filled life. After believers are baptized\nwith the Spirit, every phase of holy living and service must be the result of\nyielding to the power and presence of the Holy Spirit. In welcoming the\n\nbaptism with the Holy Spirit, God teaches believers, right from the start, the\nsecret of fully yielding to Him.\nYielding is something that it is virtually impossible to tell another how\nto do. Some have sought the fullness of the Spirit for years and wondered\nwhy they did not receive the full anointing. Upon receiving, they have testi-\nfied that if they had only known how to yield to the Spirit, they could have\nreceived years before. However, all believers must learn this important lesson\nfor themselves, for God wants all individuals to know how to let Him have\nHis way in the days to come. There is something blessedly personal about\nthis great experience with God, and it seems that the Lord has left it so all\nbelievers may learn for themselves the path of surrender.\nIt is still vitally important to realize that at no time does the Lord require\na believer to surrender his own personality. Some cults seek to bring people to\na negation of their own personality. This is dangerous, and the Lord does not\nwork this way. God has given all individuals their own personality that they\npossess and God desires to work through. The Holy Spirit does not take the\nplace of individuals. He simply seeks to shine through them, enhancing and\nglorifying their human talents. He does not supply a new set of functions, but\nuses those that are already there and yielded to Him. Moses was amazed as he\nturned aside to see the bush that was burning on the backside of the desert\n(Exod. 3:2-3). What impressed him was not that the bush was aglow, but that\nit was not consumed. Likewise, when the Holy Spirit sets the hearts and lives\nof believers aglow with the fiery glory of His presence, the individual person-\nalities are not consumed. The dross is consumed, but the life itself becomes\nradiant with God\u2019s glory.\n3. A word about \u201ctarrying\u201d for the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nIn the early days of the twentieth-century outpouring of the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit, it was quite customary to speak of \u201ctarrying\u201d for the\nbaptism with the Spirit. The idea of \u201ctarrying\u201d for the Pentecostal experience\ncomes from two verses of Scripture: \u201cBehold, I send the Promise of My Father\nupon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power\n\nfrom on high\u201d (Luke 24:49). \u201cAnd being assembled together with them, He\ncommanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise\nof the Father\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:4).\nIn obedience to these commands, the disciples did tarry a number of\ndays until the Day of Pentecost at which time they were baptized with the\nHoly Spirit. It was necessary for the disciples to wait for the promise because\nthe arrival of the Holy Spirit was set for that specific day, just as the arrival of\nJesus was set for a certain day. Clearly, the disciples could not have received\nbefore the set Day of Pentecost. Before the Day of Pentecost, it was necessary\nto wait for the promised Comforter; since the day of Pentecost, the abiding\nComforter waits for the believer. Consequently, it is now not necessary to\nwait a prolonged period of time to be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\nAn examination of all other mentions of Holy Spirit baptism in Acts\nreveals that, in every case, the believers who received the blessed experience\nreceived it in their first prayer meeting or on the first occasion they sought the\nbaptism. The apostles did not hold \u201ctarrying\u201d meetings; they held \u201creceiving\u201d\nmeetings. Now, because of a misunderstanding of the word \u201ctarry,\u201d some\nhungry seekers have been given the impression that Spirit baptism can only\nbe received after weeks or months of tarrying. Those who have been given\nthis impression may find it hard to exercise faith for immediate reception.\nTherefore, seekers should be taught that the Spirit is willing to fill them as\nsoon as they open their hearts, yield their lives and exercise faith.\nWhen conducting a prayer meeting for individuals to experience the bap-\ntism with the Holy Spirit, it is important to understand what is happening\nin the prayer gathering. Believers are not waiting for God to be ready, but\nrather God is waiting for the believer to be ready. Note the manner in which\nbelievers received the Holy Spirit in the revival at Samaria:\nNow when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that\nSamaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter\nand John to them, who, when they had come down,\nprayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.\n\nFor as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had\nonly been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then\nthey laid hands on them, and they received the Holy\nSpirit (Acts 8:14-17).\nWhen the apostles from Jerusalem went to Samaria, they found a great\nrevival in progress. Many had been gloriously saved, but none had received\nthe Holy Spirit. The apparent reason for this was they had not received teach-\ning on this subject. After Peter and John taught them concerning the Holy\nSpirit, they held a prayer meeting with the new converts, laid hands on them\nand the Spirit was poured out. In Samaria, there was no \u201ctarrying,\u201d but there\nwas certainly praying.\nThe question might well be asked in light of the Scripture, \u201cWhy do\nmany pray a long period of time before receiving?\u201d The Bible does not record\na single case of an individual seeking for a long period of time before receiv-\ning. This might be because the biblical examples are taken from an era of\nmore ideal conditions. Faith was high, and doctrinal teachings were quite\nuniform. The apostles were men of great faith and spiritual power who cre-\nated high expectancy in those who heard them. This is not always the case\ntoday. When churches do not cultivate an environment of expectancy and\nfaith, many seeking a deeper experience may not fully realize what they are\nseeking and may not have the faith to expect immediate results. Regardless,\nJesus is the same today as in the early days of the Spirit-filled church. The\nreception of the Spirit today does not need to differ from what is revealed\nin Scripture.\nAlong with the issues previously mentioned, the following conditions\ncould also cause delay in receiving the fullness of God\u2019s promise: weak faith,\nunholy living, lack of surrender and egocentric motives.\nWeak faith in individuals could be caused by their meager knowledge\nof the blessing to be received and the notion that long periods of \u201ctarrying\u201d\nare invariably necessary before receiving. Followers with appropriating faith\nbelieve the blessing is available now.\n\nBecause the Holy Spirit is holy, unholy living could also be a real barrier\nto receiving His fullness. Paul spoke of the necessity of cleansing before a\nvessel can be \u201cuseful for the Master.\u201d A desire to \u201cdepart from iniquity\u201d (2\nTim. 2:19-21) should precede an individual\u2019s desire to be baptized with the\nHoly Spirit.\nLack of surrender can also be a hindrance to receiving. The baptism with\nthe Spirit is given to empower individuals for service and holy living. Anyone\nwho seeks the fullness of the Spirit without intention of following or serving\nthe Lord should remember Paul\u2019s admonition to \u201c\u2026present your bodies a\nliving sacrifice\u2026which is your reasonable service\u201d (Rom. 12:1).\nFinally, the egocentric motives of believers may also be a reason for a\ndelay in receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit. When individuals desire\nthe baptism with the Spirit, their intentions should not be selfish but rather\nfor the purpose of being more useful to God, for the winning of souls and the\nextension of His kingdom. The baptism with the Holy Spirit is not a badge of\nspiritual prestige. Rather, it is a gift available to all Christians for the purpose\nof godly living, radiant witnessing and powerful service.\nG. Ways the baptism with the Holy Spirit was received in the New\nTestament church\nThe following outline shows the various ways in which the baptism with\nthe Holy Spirit was received in the New Testament church. God is a God of\ninfinite variety. Therefore, it should not be assumed that these are the only\nways the Spirit can be received.\n1. Suddenly, while sitting and expecting Him to come (Acts 2:1-4)\n2. Instantly and unexpectedly, while listening to the proclamation of the\ngospel (Acts 10:44-46)\n3. Through prayer and the laying on of the apostles\u2019 hands (Acts 8:14-17;\n9:17; 19:6)\n\n4. Through the seeker\u2019s personal prayer and faith (Luke 11:9-13; John\n7:37-39)\n5. Immediately following water baptism (Acts 19:5-6)\nH. The evidence and results of receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is accompanied by unmistakable evi-\ndences so that recipients of this great and important experience have con-\nfidence that they have indeed received the promise of the Father. Some of\nthe evidence is manifested immediately, while other evidence continues on a\npermanent basis as believers walk in the fullness of the Spirit.\n1. Immediate evidences\na) Speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance is an\nimmediate evidence of the baptism with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:4; 10:44-\n46; 19:6). The issue of essential evidence is of paramount importance to\nall who hunger for the baptism with the Holy Spirit. It seems logical that\nthe supernatural experience of the baptism with the Holy Spirit would\nbe accompanied by a definite and unmistakable sign to assure seekers\nthat they have received the Spirit\u2019s fullness. There are many operations of\nthe Spirit, but only one baptism with the Spirit. If there were not a par-\nticular, supernatural evidence of the baptism with the Spirit, individuals\nwould not be able to distinguish this experience from other operations\nof the Spirit.\nWe believe that the essential evidence of the baptism with the Holy\nSpirit is speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.10 The\n10 Editor\u2019s note: Although Duffield and Van Cleave were theologians within the Foursquare Church, the\nlanguage they used here concerning \u201cinitial evidence\u201d and the baptism with the Holy Spirit is not the word-\ning found in the Declaration of Faith compiled in 1923 by Aimee Semple McPherson, the founder of the\nFoursquare Church. Duffield and Van Cleave used the term \u201cinitial evidence\u201d to describe the function of\nspeaking in tongues as it relates to the baptism with the Holy Spirit. However, the statement on the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit in the Declaration of Faith did not use the term \u201cinitial evidence\u201d but rather said, \u201c\u2026\nthe believer may have every reason to expect His incoming to be after the same manner (Acts 2:4) as that\n\nevidence of the Spirit\u2019s fullness on the Day of Pentecost was that of\nspeaking with other tongues by the prompting of the Holy Spirit. \u201cAnd\nthey were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other\ntongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance\u201d (Acts 2:4). The manifestation\nof the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost was the original outpouring of the\nempowerment of the church. It was the pattern for the Pentecostal expe-\nrience. It is reasonable to expect that what the disciples did when they\nwere first filled, all believers will do when first filled with the Holy Spirit.\nAs one of the primary purposes of the baptism with the Holy Spirit is to\ngive power to witness, it is not surprising that the sign of this experience\nis manifested in the believer\u2019s utterance.\nIn addition to describing the initial outpouring of the Spirit on\nthe Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:4), the Scripture also gives the account of\nbelievers receiving the Spirit in the house of Cornelius.\nWhile Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy\nSpirit fell upon all those who heard the word. And those\nof the circumcision who believed were astonished, as\nmany as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy\nSpirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For\nthey heard them speak with tongues and magnify God\n(Acts 10:44-46).\nIt is important to note how the Jews who came with Peter deter-\nmined that these Gentiles had received the same Holy Spirit experi-\nence that the disciples of Jesus had received on the Day of Pentecost.\nThe Scripture says they knew because \u201cthey heard them speak with\nin which He came upon Jew and Gentile alike in Bible days (Acts 8:17), and as recorded in the Word (Acts\n10:44-46), that it may be truly said of us as of the house of Cornelius: (1 Cor. 3:16) the Holy Ghost fell on\nthem as on us as at the beginning\u201d (Declaration of Faith, X, The Baptism of the Holy Spirit). The Declaration\nof Faith states that the baptism with the Holy Spirit will occur in every believer\u2019s life in the same manner\nas happened in Bible days. Therefore, the Foursquare Church believes that everyone baptized with the\nHoly Spirit can speak in tongues (Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6). However, Foursquare also leaves room for the\nreality that not everyone speaks in tongues at the moment when this baptism occurs. Speaking in tongues\nis normally instantaneous with the baptism with the Holy Spirit, but experience has shown that sometimes\nit needs pastoral guidance to be released.\n\ntongues.\u201d This verse literally reads, \u201cfor they were hearing them con-\ntinuing to speak with tongues.\u201d Their speaking in tongues was not a\nbrief confusion of syllables but a full and flowing speaking of a lan-\nguage that brought amazement to the hearers. If those present were\nconvinced that the Gentiles had an equivalent, Holy Spirit experience\nto those on the day of Pentecost, based on the evidence that they also\nwere speaking with tongues, then tongues must be the unmistakable\nsign or essential evidence of the Pentecostal experience.11 Believers can\nknow that their baptism is a genuine Pentecostal experience equiva-\nlent to that of the disciples when they experience speaking with other\ntongues by the power of the Spirit. Believers are not to seek the tongues\nbut the Spirit Himself. However, believers can be confident that they\nwill experience the same sign that Spirit-filled believers experienced in\nthe Bible.\nA third account that specifically mentions that believers spoke with\ntongues after receiving the fullness of the Spirit is recorded in Acts 19:6:\n\u201cAnd when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon\nthem, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\u201d It is important to\nnote that this event occurred in the city of Ephesus. Some argue that\nthe evidence of speaking with other tongues was only given when a\nnew racial group accepted the gospel, such as the Jews at Pentecost, the\nSamaritans in Philip\u2019s revival and the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius.\nThis theory breaks down in the Acts 19:6 passage because this is not the\nstory of a new ethnic group receiving the gospel. The same is also true of\nthe Corinthians who certainly spoke with tongues.\nSome do not believe that tongues is the exclusive evidence because\nthe Bible does not always mention tongues in connection with the bap-\ntism with the Holy Spirit.12 Although it is true that three Spirit-baptism\naccounts say nothing of tongues, the omission is most likely due to the\nbrevity of those accounts. The scriptural record of the outpouring on the\nSamaritans does not mention the accompanying sign of tongues (Acts\n11 See footnote 10.\n12 See footnote 10.\n\n8:14-19). However, the fact that Simon was willing to pay money for the\npower to impart the gift of the Spirit shows that some audible or visible\nsign made the gift spectacular. It seems logical to assume that he heard\nthem speak with tongues.\nIn Acts 4:31 there is also no mention of tongues. However, this scrip-\nture seems to describe a refilling of those who were initially baptized on\nthe Day of Pentecost. \u201cAnd when they had prayed, the place where they\nwere assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the\nHoly Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.\u201d\nIn Acts 9:17 Luke does not mention that Paul spoke with tongues\nwhen he received the Spirit. However, it is certain from Paul\u2019s testimony\nthat tongues played an integral role in his Spirit-filled life: \u201cI thank my\nGod I speak with tongues more than you all\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 14:18).\nIn the connection between tongues and essential evidence, two other\nthoughts should be noted. First, the Bible\u2019s first and last accounts of\nthe reception of the Holy Spirit mention that the recipients spoke with\ntongues (Acts 2:4; 19:6). Second, in every account of the outpouring of\nthe Holy Spirit in which an immediate sign is mentioned, tongues is sig-\nnified. When the Scripture does not speak of a sign, there is still implied\nevidence that the recipients did speak in tongues.\nThe Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (PCCNA)\nis an association of over 90 million followers of Christ in 32 Spirit-filled\nNorth American denominations. The PCCNA\u2019s statement of faith, which\nis agreed to by all member groups, states the following: \u201cWe believe\nthe full gospel includes holiness of heart and life, healing for the body\nand baptism in the Holy Spirit, with the initial evidence of speaking in\ntongues as the Spirit gives utterance.\u201d13\n13 https://pccna.org/about_statement.aspx\n\nSome teach that the initial evidence of tongues is not always neces-\nsary to assure that a person has received the fullness of the Spirit.14 They\nbelieve that any of the other gifts of the Spirit can also be the evidence\nof the Pentecostal experience. These individuals sometimes mention Acts\n19:6 where it is written that \u201c\u2026they spoke with tongues and prophe-\nsied.\u201d The Bible does not mention that individuals will only speak with\ntongues when filled with the Spirit. Other gifts may also be manifested.\nAll that is claimed in this instance is that the newly baptized believers at\nEphesus spoke with tongues and prophesied.\nThe uniqueness of tongues in comparison to any of the other gifts is\none of the primary reasons it is the sign of Holy Spirit infilling. All of the\ngifts of the Spirit seem to have been manifested in Old Testament times\nwith the exception of speaking with other tongues and the accompany-\ning gift of interpretation of tongues. Note the word of wisdom of Joshua\n(Deut. 34:9) and Solomon (1 Kings 3:9-12); the word of knowledge of\nBezalel (Exod. 31:1-3); the faith of Abraham (Gen. 15:6); the gift of\nhealing in Elijah (1 Kings 17:17-23) and Elisha (2 Kings 4:18-37); the\nworking of miracles in Elijah (2 Kings 1:10), Elisha (2 Kings 6:4-7) and\nMoses (Exod. 7:10-20); the prophecy of Isaiah, David (2 Sam. 23:2) and\nBalaam (Num. 24:2); the discerning of spirits by Ahijah (1 Kings 14:1-6)\nand Moses (Exod. 32:17-19). God did a new thing at Pentecost, some-\nthing that no one had ever experienced. The sign accompanying this new\nthing was something no one had ever witnessed. Consequently, speaking\nin tongues was and is a very significant and powerful sign.\nb) Important points to note concerning the initial evidence\nof tongues:\n(1) Speaking in tongues is not the baptism with the Holy Spirit; it is\nthe initial evidence.15\n14 As mentioned in footnote 10, the Foursquare denomination believes that speaking in tongues is available\nto all who have been baptized in the Holy Spirit, yet Foursquare also recognizes that not everyone seems\nto be able to speak in tongues at the moment when this baptism occurs. Regardless, the gift of tongues is\navailable to every person baptized in the Holy Spirit whether or not it is initially evidenced.\n15 See footnotes 10 and 14.\n\n(2) Believers should not seek to speak with tongues as though the\nspeaking in tongues is the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Instead, they\nshould earnestly seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit. God will provide\ntongues as a sign of the Holy Spirit\u2019s infilling.\n(3) Some individuals who have not received the baptism with the\nHoly Spirit have claimed to speak in tongues. The word \u201cclaimed\u201d is used\nbecause these \u201ctongues\u201d may not have been from the Holy Spirit. Satan\nhas a counterfeit for the gift of tongues as he does for all other gifts. Even\nso, earnest Christian seekers can have confidence that they will receive\nthe fulfillment of God\u2019s promise when they yield to the fullness of the\nSpirit (Luke 11:11-13).\nc) Other immediate evidences\nOther immediate evidences that accompany the baptism with the\nHoly Spirit include: prophecy (Acts 2:17-18; 19:6); praise to God (Acts\n2:11, 47; 10:46); an overflowing joy (Acts 2:46); an awareness of the resur-\nrected Jesus (Acts 2:32) and a deep burden and desire to preach or testify\nabout Jesus (Acts 1:8; 2:14-18; 3:31; 19:6).\n2. Permanent evidences\na) The baptism with the Holy Spirit glorifies and reveals Jesus Christ\nas never before (John 14:21-23; 15:26; 16:13-15). The Holy Spirit cen-\nters all things in Christ. The baptism with the Holy Spirit produces a new\nlove for Jesus that will increase in intimacy as the believer continues in\nthe Spirit-filled life. The Holy Spirit makes believers able to comprehend\nthe person, provisions and greatness of Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:17-23).\nb) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers power to con-\ntinue the miraculous ministry of Jesus. Jesus told his disciples to \u201c\u2026tarry\nin the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high\u201d\n(Luke 24:49; John 14:12; Acts 1:8).\n\nc) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers a deeper passion\nto save unbelievers. It is clear that after the Day of Pentecost there was\na burning desire among the followers of Christ to proclaim the way of\nsalvation (Acts 2:14-41; 4:19-20; 5:29-33; 6:8-10; 11:22-24; 26:28-29).\nd) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers a greater power\nand boldness to witness (Acts 1:8; 2:41; 4:31-33; John 15:26-27; 1 Cor.\n2:4-5).\ne) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers a new power in\nand desire for prayer and worship (Acts 2:11; 3:1; 4:23-31; 6:4; 10:9;\nRom. 8:26; 1 Cor. 14:14-17; Eph. 5:18-20; 6:18; Jude 20).\nf) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers a deeper love for\nand richer insight into the Word of God (John 6:3).\ng) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers manifestations of\nthe gifts of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-11).\nh) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers power for holy\nliving (Rom. 8:12-13; Gal. 5:16-24).\ni) The baptism with the Holy Spirit gives believers a deeper love for\none another (Acts 2:42-46; 4:32-34)\nI. Additional infillings with the Holy Spirit\nThe baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience in a Christian\u2019s\nlife. But it is more than just an experience; it is a way of life. An experience\nis of little value if it does not transform an individual\u2019s life. This is particu-\nlarly true of the baptism with the Spirit. A short season of spiritual ecstasy is\nvery blessed while it lasts, but its value is limited if it does not lead to daily,\npermanent, Spirit-filled living. The baptism with the Holy Spirit should lead\n\nbelievers into a consistent, Spirit-filled life. Paul admonished Christians:\n\u201cAnd do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with\nthe Spirit\u2026\u201d (Eph. 5:18). This scripture literally says, \u201cBe being filled with\nthe Spirit\u201d which implies a continuous experience. The book of Acts seems\nto indicate that there is one baptism but many infillings. The following is\na brief outline of four additional fillings the disciples received after the day\nof Pentecost.\n1. Infilling for defending the faith: \u201cThen Peter, filled with the Holy\nSpirit, said to them, \u2018Rulers of the people and elders of Israel\u2026\u2019\u201d (Acts 4:8).\nFollowing the healing of the lame man at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple\nand the great sermon Peter preached in Solomon\u2019s Porch, the disciples were\nimprisoned. The following morning, the Sanhedrin brought them out and\nasked the question, \u201cBy what power or by what name have you done this?\u201d\n(Acts 4:7). Peter\u2019s bold and inspiring answer was the result of being \u201cfilled\nwith the Spirit.\u201d Jesus had told them that times like these would come, but\nthe Holy Spirit would teach them what to say in that hour. \u201cNow when they\nbring you to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities, do not worry\nabout how or what you should answer, or what you should say. For the Holy\nSpirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say\u201d (Luke 12:11-\n12). The leaders \u201cmarveled\u201d at the disciples\u2019 new-found boldness (Acts 4:13).\n2. Infilling for rebuking the power of the devil: \u201cThen Saul, who also is\ncalled Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said, \u2018O\nfull of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righ-\nteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?\u2019\u201d (Acts\n13:9-10). In this passage, Paul was on the island of Cyprus ministering to the\ndeputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, when the sorcerer, Elymas, sought to\nturn the deputy away from the faith. Paul received a special anointing of the\nSpirit and rebuked Elymas. When Satan seeks to hinder the word of God,\nbelievers may expect special infillings of the Holy Spirit to help them over-\ncome the enemy and succeed in following God\u2019s will.\n3. Infilling to give disciples new boldness and power: \u201cAnd when they\nhad prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and\nthey were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God\n\nwith boldness\u201d (Acts 4:31). This happened after the Sanhedrin had com-\nmanded the disciples and threatened them, \u201c\u2026that from now on they speak\nto no man in this name\u201d (Acts 4:17). In response to this threat, the disciples\nresorted to prayer, and a new filling with the Spirit came upon them that gave\nthem boldness and power to continue preaching the word of God.\n4. Infilling for grace and power to endure persecutions for the sake of the\ngospel: \u201cAnd the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit\u201d (Acts\n13:52). As a result of their great success in preaching the gospel in Antioch\nof Pisidia, \u201c\u2026the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and\nthe chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas,\nand expelled them from their region. But they shook off the dust from their\nfeet against them, and came to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with\njoy and with the Holy Spirit\u201d (Acts 13:50-52). No individual enjoys being\npersecuted. However, in response to this persecution, the disciples received a\nspecial filling of the Holy Spirit. The Greek verb used here is in the imperfect\ntense, signifying that they were being continuously filled with the Holy Spirit.\nIn response to daily persecution, they experienced a fresh daily infilling.\nV. Offenses Against the Holy Spirit\nThe New Testament mentions six offenses against the Holy Spirit. This\ntext will divide those offenses into those committed by unbelievers and those\nby believers. Even so, there may be overlap between the two categories.\nA. Offenses committed by unbelievers\n1. Resisting the Holy Spirit: \u201cYou stiff-necked and uncircumcised in\nheart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do\nyou\u201d (Acts 7:51). These words were proclaimed by Stephen as he spoke to\nthe unbelieving Sanhedrin. The Holy Spirit seeks to speak to the heart of the\nunbelievers to lead them to God. The Spirit is patient and persistent, but it\nis possible to resist His pleadings (Gen. 6:3). Although the religious leaders\neven recognized the wisdom or truth of the Spirit\u2019s message (Acts 6:10), they\nwere unwilling to yield to the leading of the Spirit in their hearts.\n\n2. Insulting the Holy Spirit: \u201cOf how much worse punishment, do you\nsuppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God under-\nfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a com-\nmon thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?\u201d (Heb. 10:29). The Holy Spirit\npresents the saving work of Jesus Christ to the unsaved. When individuals\nrefuse to accept Jesus Christ, they are actually insulting the love of God man-\nifested in the \u201cSpirit of grace.\u201d To resist the Spirit\u2019s appeal is to insult God and\nreject His salvation.\n3. Blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the unpardonable sin:\nTherefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will\nbe forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit\nwill not be forgiven men. Anyone who speaks a word\nagainst the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but\nwhoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be\nforgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come\n(Matt. 12:31-32; see also Mark 3:28-30; Luke 12:10).\nThis is the most serious offense against the Holy Spirit, for there is no for-\ngiveness for individuals who commit it. To understand what constitutes blas-\nphemy against the Holy Spirit, it is important to look at the context of this\nscripture (see Matt. 12:22-30). The Pharisees were accusing Jesus of working\nmiracles by the power of the devil when he had just cast out a demon by the\npower of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the Pharisees were attributing the\nwork of the Holy Spirit to the devil. Mark\u2019s version of this event specifically\nnotes that Jesus spoke these words about blasphemy \u201cbecause they said, \u2018He\nhas an unclean spirit\u2019\u201d (Mark 3:28-30). It is important to realize that Jesus\nwas not talking about a one-time rejection of the Holy Spirit. If that were the\ncase, Jesus would not have warned the Pharisees against continuing to reject\nthe Holy Spirit as the Spirit of God.\nB. Offenses committed by believers\n1. Grieving the Holy Spirit: \u201cAnd do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,\nby whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath,\n\nanger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice\u201d (Eph.\n4:30-31). To grieve means to make sad or sorrowful or to offend. Individuals\ngrieve the Holy Spirit when they say and do things that are against God\u2019s will\nand unlike God\u2019s nature. It seems clear that the Holy Spirit grieves because\nHe loves and desires the best for those who follow Him.\n2. Lying to the Holy Spirit: \u201cBut Peter said, \u2018Ananias, why has Satan filled\nyour heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land\nfor yourself?\u2019\u201d (Acts 5:3). When individuals consecrate something to the Lord\nbut do not follow through on that consecration, they are lying to the Holy\nSpirit. They may pledge to consecrate money, time, service or other worthy\nthings. However, if believers do not intend to be faithful to their promises,\nthey are lying to God and would most likely have been better off not making\nthe false promise in the first place. Believers who make false commitments\nbefore other believers are actually making false commitments to God. Peter\nconfirmed this truth when he told Ananias, \u201cYou have not lied to men but to\nGod\u201d (Acts 5:4).\n3. Quenching the Holy Spirit: \u201cDo not quench the Spirit\u201d (1 Thess.\n5:19). The thought of quenching suggests an individual trying to put out or\nextinguish a fire. Unbelief, fear, fleshly criticism and the need to control may\nall serve to quench the Holy Spirit moving in an individual or congregation.\nBelievers and believing communities must continually examine their actions\nand attitudes to make sure they are not limiting the work of the Holy Spirit\nin their lives and gatherings.\nVI. The Gifts of the Spirit\nA thorough treatment of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit cannot be made\nwithout carefully examining what the Bible teaches about the gifts of the\nSpirit. In the New Testament, three entire chapters and two partial chapters\nare devoted to addressing the gifts of the Spirit. There are approximately one\nhundred New Testament references to the subject of spiritual gifts and the\nexercise of those gifts. This does not include references to the miracles of Jesus\n\nrecorded in the Gospels. In spite of the frequent manifestations of the Spirit\nmentioned in the New Testament, many doctrine and theology books ignore,\nlessen or misunderstand the importance of the gifts of the Spirit in the believ-\ner\u2019s life. Although some claim that the gifts of the Spirit ceased at the end of\nthe apostolic age and the canonization of Scripture, there is not the slight-\nest inference in the New Testament that any endowment of the Holy Spirit\nwould cease before Christ\u2019s return. In fact, the apostle Paul wrote that none\nof these gifts will pass away until we \u201csee Him face to face\u201d (1 Cor. 13:12).\nThe gifts of the Spirit play an integral role in the theology of Pentecostal\nbelievers and denominations. Regarding spiritual gifts, Foursquare\u2019s Declaration\nof Faith says the following:\nWe believe that the Holy Spirit has the following gifts\nto bestow upon the believing church of the Lord Jesus\nChrist: wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing miracles,\nprophecy, discernment, tongues, interpretation; that,\naccording to the degree of grace and faith possessed by\nthe recipient, these gifts are divided to every man sever-\nally, as He, the Holy Spirit will; that they are to be ear-\nnestly desired and coveted, in the order and proportion\nwherein they prove most edifying and beneficial to the\nchurch ...16\nA. The background for spiritual gifts\n1. The promise given\nJesus told His followers that special spiritual enablement would be\nprovided so that they could carry out God\u2019s mission for the church. Jesus\ninstructed His followers that before they were to go into the world and preach\n\u201crepentance and remission of sins,\u201d they were to wait until they were \u201cendued\nwith power from on high\u201d (Luke 24:47-49). In giving the Great Commission,\n16 Aimee Semple McPherson, Declaration of Faith (Los Angeles, CA: international Church of the\nFoursquare Gospel, n.d.) 19.\n\nJesus promised that, \u201cAnd these signs shall follow them that believe\u201d (Mark\n16:17, KJV), such signs as: casting out demons, speaking with \u201cnew\u201d tongues\nand the recovery from sickness by the laying on of hands (Mark 16:18). When\nJesus announced His return to the Father, He promised His followers that He\nwould send the Comforter who would abide forever, teach them all things,\nbring all His sayings to their remembrance, guide them into all truth, convict\nthe world of sin, righteousness and judgment, and testify of Jesus.\n2. The promise fulfilled\nOn the Day of Pentecost, the promised Holy Spirit was poured out upon\nthe waiting church with visible and audible signs (Acts 2:1-4). Those baptized\nwith the Spirit began to speak in tongues as promised by Jesus (Mark 16:17).\nOnce these believers were filled with the Holy Spirit, they were so thoroughly\nenabled by the Spirit\u2019s power that everywhere their ministry was marked by\nthe supernatural. The disciples were not mere guardians of orthodoxy; they\nwere ambassadors of Christ, equipped with God-given capabilities. They had\na divine work to do and a divine power to do it. This is also true of Christians\ntoday. The church\u2019s mission is more than propagating a new philosophy or\ncalling people to a new morality. Instead, the church\u2019s mission is to deliver\npeople from the bondage of Satan; it is to bind the enemy and loose the\nbound in the name of Jesus (Matt. 16:19). It is true that a certain amount of\nworthy philosophizing and moralizing can be done with mere human capa-\nbilities, but to deliver individuals from bondage and bring them to repen-\ntance and faith requires an anointing of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 3:4-6). God\ntakes natural capacities and transforms them into spiritual operations (Exod.\n35:29-35; Rom. 15:13-14; 1 Tim. 1:7-9; 2 Tim. 2:2). God accepts and hon-\nors all human talent dedicated to His service, but He enhances and empowers\nthose talents through the Holy Spirit.\nB. The vocabulary of spiritual gifts\nThe vocabulary Scripture uses to address spiritual gifts demonstrates to\na large degree the nature of those gifts. The first reference to the gifts of\nthe Spirit as a general class of phenomena is found in 1 Corinthians, which\nwas written about A.D. 55. First Corinthians 12-14 are devoted entirely to\n\nspiritual gifts. First Corinthians 12:1-7 deals with the gifts as a class and\nprovides a vocabulary for their description. The New Testament uses the fol-\nlowing Greek words to refer to spiritual gifts.\n1. Pneumatika (spiritual gifts/spirituals): \u201cNow concerning spiritual gifts\n[pneumatika], brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:1).\nAlthough translated as \u201cspiritual gifts,\u201d pneumatika literally meaning \u201cspiri-\ntuals\u201d or \u201cthings of the Spirit\u201d (see also 1 Cor. 14:1). The \u201cspirituals\u201d in one\nsense are gifts, but they are more than gifts as will be shown.\n2. Charismata (gifts/spiritual gifts/grace-gifts): \u201cThere are diversities of\ngifts [charismata], but the same Spirit\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:4). The Greek word cha-\nrisma is rendered \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cspiritual gift.\u201d It comes from the basic word charis,\nwhich means \u201cgrace.\u201d A charisma is a grace-gift: an enablement, an endow-\nment or a blessing bestowed freely by God. The text in Corinthians refers to\nthe gifts (charismata) as spirituals (pneumatika) because they are capacities\nfreely bestowed by the Holy Spirit. They come from God and cannot be mer-\nited or earned. Although they operate through Spirit-filled persons, they are\ngifts from God to the church and the world (1 Cor. 12:11-27).\n3. Diakoniai (ministries): \u201cThere are differences of ministries [diako-\nniai]\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:5). The spirituals (pneumatika) are gifts (charismata) in\nregard to their origin and source, but they are ministries (diakoniai) in regard\nto their application. Individuals who exercise their spiritual gifts in the body\nminister to the body. There are as many kinds of ministries as there are spir-\nitual gifts and spiritual offices. The gifts are not merit awards, nor are they\ngiven primarily to benefit the possessor. Instead, the Spirit imparts the cha-\nrismata for believers to minister to others. The value of the gifts resides in\ntheir capacity to minister spiritual profit and edification to the body and to\nempower the church to reach out to the world.\n4. Energemata (activities): \u201cAnd there are diversities of activities [energe-\nmata]\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:6). The spirituals (pneumatika) are activities (energemata)\nin the sense that they are gifts and ministries \u201cactivated\u201d by the Holy Spirit.\nThe Greek word for \u201cactivities\u201d is energema, which means \u201cactive principle\u201d or\n\n\u201ceffect.\u201d The English word \u201cenergy\u201d comes from the same root. The spiritual\ngifts are activities of the Spirit that produce spiritual effects.\n5. Phanerosis (manifestations): \u201cBut the manifestation [phanerosis] of the\nSpirit is given to each one for the profit of all\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:7). Every opera-\ntion of the spirituals (pneumatika) is a manifestation (phanerosis) of the Spirit.\nManifestation is defined as an \u201coutward evidence.\u201d The gifts of the Spirit give\noutward evidence of the Holy Spirit at work. Individuals become aware of\nGod\u2019s presence through the operation of the gifts. Every Spirit-filled believer\nis given some capacity for the manifestation of the Spirit. This manifestation\nis ultimately for the benefit and profit of the whole body: \u201cBut the manifes-\ntation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:7).\n6. Diairesis (diversities/differences): \u201cThere are diversities [diairesis] of\u2026\u201d\n(1 Cor. 12:4-6). The idea behind \u201cdiversities\u201d or \u201cdifferences\u201d is that of distri-\nbution. God is a God of infinite variety. The \u201cspirituals\u201d are of great variety,\nbut there is one Lord and one Holy Spirit operating in the great diversities of\nspiritual manifestations and ministries.\nIt is not God\u2019s intention that only a few gifts operate through a lim-\nited number of believers. There are many different spiritual gifts, far more\nthan the nine mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12. In fact, there may be as many\ngifts as there are useful functions in the church or needs in the world. Every\nbeliever should have some manifestation of the Spirit, and all the gifts of the\nSpirit should be available to every church body.\nC. The purpose of spiritual gifts\nThe purpose of the spiritual gifts is for the edification and profit of the\nchurch. \u201cEven so you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, let it be for the\nedification of the church that you seek to excel\u201d (1 Cor. 14:12; see also 1 Cor.\n14:26). If the exercise of the gifts does not edify and build up the body, they\nare valueless. Gifts are bestowed with the purpose of bringing spiritual profit\nand edification to the whole body. \u201cBut the manifestation of the Spirit is\ngiven to each one for the profit of all\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 12:7). An individual who\n\nexercises his or her gifts without love or merely for personal display is a \u201c\u2026\nsounding brass or a clanging cymbal\u201d that profits no one (1 Cor. 13:1).\nProphecy is one example of how spiritual gifts build up and profit the\nchurch. Paul wrote that prophecy has the following effects: \u201cBut he who\nprophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men\u201d (1 Cor.\n14:3).\n1. Edification: The word \u201cedification\u201d comes from the Greek word oiko-\ndome and means \u201cthe act of building a structure.\u201d The vocal gifts are intended\nto build Christ\u2019s church.\n2. Exhortation: The word \u201cexhortation\u201d translates the Greek word parak-\nlesis means \u201cto exhort or encourage.\u201d It is related to the word Paraclete, the\nname Jesus used to speak of the Holy Spirit. The name \u201cBarnabas\u201d was said\nto mean \u201cson of consolation\u201d or \u201cson of encouragement.\u201d The Greek word\ntranslated as \u201cconsolation\u201d is also paraklesis. The ministry of Barnabas was a\ngreat blessing and profit to the whole church, especially the church at Antioch\n(Acts 11:22-26). The verb form of paraklesis (exhortation) is frequently trans-\nlated \u201cI beseech you.\u201d Individuals who exhort the church stir and motivate\nbelievers to do God\u2019s whole will. The author of Hebrews provided a good\nexample of this kind of exhortation: \u201cAnd let us consider one another in order\nto stir up love and good works\u2026\u201d (Heb. 10:24).\n3. Comfort: The word \u201ccomfort\u201d from the Greek word paramuthia means\n\u201cto sooth, comfort, console.\u201d The church often needs the ministry of comfort\nor consolation during times of persecution, trials and sorrow.\nThere is a process of growth and maturity in the exercising of spiritual\ngifts. God desires that believers exercise the gifts maturely in order that the\nchurch is truly edified: \u201cBrethren, do not be children in understanding\u2026but\nin understanding be mature\u201d (1 Cor. 14:20). Paul taught extensively about\nthe mature use of spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 14). Christians should give attention\nto these teachings wherever the gifts of the Spirit are in operation.\n\nD. The gifts enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12\nIn 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, Paul first enumerated nine gifts of the Spirit.\nHowever, in 1 Corinthians 12:28, after repeating the mention of miracles,\nhealings and tongues, Paul added the gifts of helps and administrations with-\nout making any distinction in classification. Paul did not distinguish sharply\nbetween the offices of apostles, prophets and teachers, and the endowments\nof miracles, healings and tongues. Apparently, when God sets apart individ-\nuals for an office, He bestows upon them spiritual enablements that corre-\nsponded with the office or ministry. Perhaps the mention of two additional\ngifts in 1 Corinthians 12:28 was made to show that the number of gifts could\nbe lengthened considerably.\nSome have seen the need to fix the number of gifts at nine to cor-\nrespond with the nine fruits of the Spirit. However, a careful search will\nreveal other fruits of the Spirit in addition to the nine listed in Galatians 5.\nAlso, Paul mentioned 17 works of the flesh and then ended the list with the\nphrase \u201cand such like\u201d (Gal. 5:21, KJV). If there are works of the flesh not\nmentioned in Scripture, it is possible that some of the fruit and gifts of the\nSpirit were not mentioned as well. In 1 Corinthians 12-14, Paul mentioned\nthe gifts that were well known to the Corinthians; in Romans he introduced\nother gifts that illustrated his discussion. August Hermann Cremer argued\nthat Paul\u2019s gift lists are not exhaustive:\nThe place, therefore, that each member has in the com-\nmunity he has by virtue of a \u201ccharisma,\u201d which he is to\nadminister to his brethren (1 Pet. 4:10). Natural pow-\ners as such are useless to the life of the body of Christ;\nwhat it needs must, like itself, be spiritual. Charismata,\nthen, may be defined as powers and capacities neces-\nsary for the edification of the church, bestowed by the\nHoly Spirit upon its members, in virtue of which they\nare enabled to employ their natural abilities in the ser-\nvice of the church, or are endowed with new abilities\nfor this purpose. According to 1 Cor. 12:11-18; Rom.\n12:5-8; Eph. 4:11, the \u201ccharismata\u201d form the basis of\n\nthe offices in the church. There can be no office with-\nout a charisma; but not all charismata are applicable to\nthe exercise of an office. Those that correspond to the\npermanent and invariable needs of the church form the\nbasis of offices, the others do not ... Since the number\nof the charismata must correspond to the needs of the\nchurch, it follows that the lists in 1 Cor. 12, Eph. 4, and\nRom. 12 cannot be taken as exhaustive.17\n1. Word of wisdom\nThis is not the gift of wisdom in general, but the gift of a \u201cword of\nwisdom.\u201d However, by itself it is not necessarily a vocal gift. Word (logos) is\ndefined as a concept, idea, saying, subject matter, reason, narrative or doc-\ntrine. If \u201cutterance\u201d had been meant, probably the Greek word rhema would\nhave been used instead of logos. Working together with prophecy, the word\nof wisdom could function as a vocal gift. It is likely that this is the gift that\noperated in Stephen in Acts 6:10: \u201cAnd they were not able to resist the wis-\ndom and the Spirit by which he spoke.\u201d When settling a dispute in the early\nchurch, the Jerusalem Council wrote: \u201cFor it seemed good to the Holy Spirit,\nand to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things\u2026\u201d\n(Acts 15:28). The mind of the Holy Spirit was probably conveyed to the\napostles by a word of wisdom. Wisdom, in contrast to knowledge, probably\nmeans an insight for \u201cpractical conduct or action.\u201d In local church life, there\nare times when important decisions need to be made through the leading\nof the Holy Spirit. The operation of a word of wisdom provides the Spirit\u2019s\nguidance (see 1 Cor. 2:13-16).\n2. Word of knowledge\nPaul\u2019s statement in 1 Corinthians 1:5 may refer to the gift of a word of\nknowledge: \u201c\u2026that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance\nand all knowledge.\u201d If a word of wisdom gives insight for practical action, a\n17 August Hermann Cremer, The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge (Grand Rapids,\nMI: Baker Book House, 1949-50) III, 11.\n\nword of knowledge brings to light the principles of doctrine that form a basis\nfor the action. A word of knowledge may bring scriptural truth to the atten-\ntion of the church, or it may reveal facts that are needed for further response.\nPaul had confidence that spiritual knowledge operated in the church when\nhe wrote: \u201cNow I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that\nyou also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish\none another\u201d (Rom. 15:14). John probably exercised the gift of a word of\nknowledge when discerning the spiritual conditions of the seven churches\nhe addressed in Revelation (Rev. 2-3). The word of wisdom and word of\nknowledge are gifts to guide believers in knowledge and action. Gifts of rev-\nelation work in harmony with the Bible never contradicting the teachings of\nScripture (1 Pet. 4:11; 2 Pet. 1:20-21).\n3. Special faith\nMany writers on the gifts refer to the gift of faith as that of \u201cspecial faith.\u201d\nThis is because the gift of faith differs from saving faith or daily faith by\nwhich individuals come to God believing \u201c\u2026He is, and that He is a rewarder\nof those who diligently seek Him\u201d (Heb. 11:6). Although all faith is alike in\nnature, the gift of special faith differs from other faith in degree and appli-\ncation. Special faith often works in conjunction with healings and miracles.\nThe gift of faith is most likely expressed in the healing of the lame man at\nthe gate called Beautiful (Acts 3). Peter had a gift of miraculous faith to com-\nmand the lame man to rise and walk in the name of Jesus. Donald Gee wrote\nconcerning this faith:\nIt would seem to come upon certain of God\u2019s ser-\nvants in times of special crisis or opportunity in such\nmighty power that they are lifted right out of the realm\nof even natural or ordinary faith in God\u2014and have a\ndivine certainty put within their souls that triumphs\nover everything.18\n18 Donald Gee, Spiritual Gifts in the Work of the Ministry Today (Springfield, Mo: Gospel Publishing House,\n1963) 65.\n\nPerhaps Jesus was describing this quality of faith when he said to His\ndisciples, \u201cHave faith in God\u201d (Mark 11:22). The Greek in this passage lit-\nerally reads, \u201cHave the faith of God.\u201d Jesus suggested that with this divinely\nimparted faith a person might say to a mountain, \u201c\u2026Be removed and be cast\ninto the sea\u2026\u201d (Mark 11:23), and it would happen. The mountain symbol-\nized any seemingly impossible obstacle to the mission of the church.\n4. Gifts of healings\nAs a general term, charismata (gifts) is used in 1 Corinthians 12 to refer\nto all \u201cspirituals\u201d (vv. 4, 31). However, when addressing specific gifts, charis-\nmata is only attached to the gift of healing (vv. 9, 28, 30). In the Greek, the\nterms \u201cgifts\u201d and \u201chealings\u201d are plural. This suggests there are either many\ngifts of healing for different diseases or that each exercise of healing power is\na separate gift. Nowhere in the New Testament is a person said to have \u201cthe\u201d\ngift of healing. Most evangelists and pastors with effective healing ministries\ndo not claim to have the gift of healing. Certainly, no one has had the minis-\ntry of healing every sick person. On some occasions Jesus healed all who came\nto Him, but on other occasions He was limited by the lack of faith on the part\nof the people (Matt. 13:58). What is certain is that God has made physical\nhealing a ministry of His church through gifts of healings that operate along\nwith faith.\nJesus promised His disciples that signs would follow their preaching of\nthe gospel (Mark 16:15-18). One of those signs was that \u201c\u2026they will lay\nhands on the sick, and they will recover\u201d (Mark 16:18). Jesus promised that,\nfor as long as it took to preach the gospel to every creature, signs would follow\nthose who believed. One of those signs was the miraculous healing of the sick.\nSince not every creature has yet heard, it would seem that signs of healing\nare still present today. The clause \u201cthose who believe\u201d suggests the signs or\ngifts were not limited to the apostles but available to all who have faith. In\nthe command and promise of Jesus, the \u201claying on of hands\u201d is an outward\nexpression of faith and love on the part of those who pray, showing that God\nuses faithful believers as a channel of His power. In James\u2019 admonition to\npray for the sick by the laying on of hands and anointing the sick with oil,\nthe oil symbolizes the work of the Holy Spirit (Jas. 5:14-16). When Jesus sent\n\nout the twelve disciples to minister, they \u201canointed with oil many who were\nsick, and healed them\u201d (Mark 6:13). The believer is the vehicle of power, but\nhealing is the Spirit\u2019s work.\nWhile on some occasions the sick are healed through the faith of the\none who prays, faith on the part of the afflicted person is important and\nsometimes essential: \u201cPaul, observing him intently and seeing that he had\nfaith to be healed, said with a loud voice, \u2018Stand up straight on your feet!\u2019\nAnd he leaped and walked\u201d (Acts 14:9-10). Paul exercised the gifts of faith\nand healing. Nevertheless, his command to stand up was given after he dis-\ncerned that the lame man had faith to be healed. The need for the afflicted\nto have faith suggests that candidates for healing might well benefit from\nteaching that builds their faith. The most effective faith-building comes\nthrough the word of God: \u201cSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing\nby the word of God\u201d (Rom. 10:17). Old Testament promises of healing are\nfound in Exodus 15:26; 23:25; Deuteronomy 32:39; 2 Kings 20:5; Psalm\n30:1-2; 103:3; 107:17-22; Isaiah 38:4-5 and 53:5. New Testament healing\npassages are found in Matthew 4:23; 8:8, 16-17; 10:8; Mark 3:14-15; Luke\n4:40; 9:6; Acts 3:1-11; 4:30; 5:15-16; 8:7; 28:8; 1 Corinthians 12:9; James\n5:14-16 and 1 Peter 2:24.\n5. Working of miracles\nThe working of miracles is the translation of the Greek energemata\ndunameon, which literally means \u201coperations of supernatural powers.\u201d As\nwith gifts of healings, working of miracles is also plural. This is not a gift that\nmakes a person a \u201cmiracle worker.\u201d It seems from the plurality of the expres-\nsions that each miracle is operated through an individual with a gift of faith\n(see Matt. 17:20; 21:20-22). A miracle is \u201cAn event or action that apparently\ncontradicts known scientific laws and is hence thought to be due to super-\nnatural causes, especially to an act of God.\u201d19 In the New Testament, events\nof supernatural origin are called \u201cmiracles, wonders and signs\u201d (Acts 2:22,\n43; 6:8; 8:13; Heb. 2:4). The Greek words translated \u201cmiracles, wonders\n19 Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language (New York: Collins-World Publishing\nCompany, 1976) s.v. \u201cmiracle.\u201d\n\nand signs\u201d are dunameis, terata, semeia. They literally mean, \u201cevents of divine\npower,\u201d \u201cevents that cause wonderment\u201d and \u201cevents that signify something\u201d\n(about God or His working). It is noteworthy that the term \u201cwonder\u201d is\nalways used together with the term \u201csign.\u201d God does not manifest His mirac-\nulous power just for the sake of wonderment but also to bear witness to the\ngospel: \u201c\u2026how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at\nthe first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those\nwho heard Him, God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with\nvarious miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?\u201d\n(Heb. 2:3-4).\nMany examples of the working of miracles are found in the book of Acts:\nsupernatural deliverance from imprisonment (Acts 5:18-20; 12:5-10; 16:23-\n30); Elymas the sorcerer struck by blindness (Acts 13:8-12); Philip instantly\ntransported from Gaza to Azotus (Acts 8:39-40); Dorcas and Eutychus raised\nfrom the dead (Acts 9:36-42; 20:9-12); and Paul suffering no harm from\nthe bite of a poisonous snake (Acts 28:3-5). The healing of the sick and the\ncasting out of demonic spirits may also be classified as gifts of miracles when\nthey have a great sign value. Paul\u2019s ministry in Ephesus is an example of the\nworking of miracles: \u201cNow God worked unusual miracles [literally \u2018not ordi-\nnary miracles\u2019] by the hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs or aprons\nwere brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil\nspirits went out of them\u201d (Acts 19:11-12). Peter also demonstrated this kind\nof miraculous gift in Jerusalem when his shadow fell upon the sick and they\nwere healed (Acts 5:12-15).\n6. Prophecy\nThe word prophet is a transliteration from the Greek prophetes, which is\nderived from two words: pro meaning \u201cbefore, forth, for or in behalf of\u201d and\nphemi meaning to \u201cdeclare or speak.\u201d Therefore, prophetes can mean \u201cone who\npredicts\u201d (tells beforehand), \u201cone who speaks forth\u201d or \u201cone who speaks for or\nin behalf of.\u201d Since the office of the prophet begins in the Old Testament, it\nis important to look at the Hebrew definition as well. The Hebrew word for\n\u201cprophet\u201d is nabi, meaning \u201cto announce, witness or testify.\u201d The Scripture\nclearly defines the office of the prophet: \u201cI will raise up for them a Prophet\n\nlike you from among their brethren, and will put My words in His mouth,\nand He shall speak to them all that I command Him\u201d (Deut. 18:18). A\nprophet speaks to people, on behalf of God, the words God puts in his or\nher mouth. God confirmed the role of the prophet when He spoke of Aaron\nas the prophet of Moses: \u201cSee, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and\nAaron your brother shall be your prophet. You shall speak all that I command\nyou. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh\u2026\u201d (Exod. 7:1-2). Aaron was\ncalled the prophet of Moses because he spoke on behalf of Moses, delivering\nMoses\u2019 message. The same idea of speaking \u201cfor\u201d God is demonstrated by the\ntestimony of Jeremiah the prophet: \u201cThen the Lord put forth His hand and\ntouched my mouth, and the Lord said to me: \u2018Behold, I have put My words\nin your mouth\u2019\u201d (Jer. 1:9). Sometimes prophets would speak to the people, on\nGod\u2019s behalf, a message for their times; often prophets would predict coming\nevents. In either case, they were simply speaking the Lord\u2019s message.\nDeuteronomy 13 and 18 give qualifications for prophets and tests of\ntheir authenticity:\na) Prophets are taken from among the people (Deu. 18:18).\nb) Prophets are to speak to the people in the name of the Lord\n(Deu. 18:19).\nc) Prophets may show signs and wonders with their prophecies\n(Deu. 13:1).\nd) If prophets prophesy the worship or pursuit of \u201cother gods,\u201d they\nare to be rejected regardless of any accompanying signs or wonders. God\nmay allow these false prophecies to test the love of His people (Deu.\n13:1-3).\ne) If prophets predict the future and their predictions fail to come to\npass, the prophets are to be rejected (Deu. 18:20-22).\n\nThe New Testament describes two kinds of prophets: those who\noccupy the office of a prophet (Eph. 4:11) and those who exercise the\ngift of prophecy. Those of the first category are among the ministry gifts;\nthose of the second can include any Spirit-filled believer. It seems not all\ncan occupy the office of a prophet: \u201cAnd He Himself gave some to be\napostles, some prophets\u2026\u201d [Eph. 4:11], but among Spirit-filled believers\n\u201c\u2026you can all prophesy one by one\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 14:31). Joel prophesied,\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out\nof My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy\u2026I\nwill pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy\u201d (Acts\n2:17-18). Since every Spirit-filled believer can prophesy, having the gift\nof prophecy does not necessarily mean someone occupies the ministry\noffice of a prophet.\nAmong the gifts in 1 Corinthians, Paul listed prophecy as the most\nearnestly to be desired (1 Cor. 14:1, 5, 24-25, 39). Prophecy\u2019s importance\nis indicated by the fact that some form of the word is found 20 times in\n1 Corinthians 12 through 14. These chapters define prophecy in the fol-\nlowing way: \u201cBut he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation\nand comfort to men\u201d (1 Cor. 14:3). The Amplified Bible Classic Edition\ntranslates this verse: \u201c\u2026the one who prophesies\u2026speaks to men for their\nupbuilding and constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and\nconsolation.\u201d Within the local church, the gift of prophecy operates to\nspiritually build up the body.\nWhen the church faces a problem of missing facts or needs divine\nwisdom for practical action, a word of knowledge or a word of wisdom\nmay operate in conjunction with the gift of prophecy. A word of wisdom\nmay have assured the apostles in their instructions to the Gentiles \u201c\u2026\nto lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things\u2026\u201d (Acts\n15:28). When the conclusions of the Jerusalem Council were delivered\nto the Gentile church in Antioch, Luke reported: \u201cNow Judas and Silas,\nthemselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren\nwith many words\u201d (Acts 15:32). In the operation of the gift of prophecy,\nthe Spirit heavily anoints believers to speak forth to uplift and encourage\n\nindividuals, to incite people to faithful obedience and service and to\nbring hearers comfort and consolation.\nEven though prophecy proclaims the will of God, individuals do\nnot need to speak in the first person as if the voice of God is speaking\nthrough them. Although prophecy is a word from God, individuals do\nnot need to alter their voice or speaking style to prophesy. For example,\nindividuals don\u2019t need to shout to prophesy. Instead, they can simply\nspeak in their normal voice and still be prophesying. Other aspects of the\nvocal gifts will be addressed later when dealing with the gifts of tongues\nand prophecy.\n7. Discerning of spirits\n\u201cDiscerning of spirits\u201d comes from the Greek diakreisis pneumaton. The\nGreek word diakreisis is defined \u201cto discern, to discriminate or to distin-\nguish.\u201d The verb form is used in Hebrews 5:14: \u201cBut solid food belongs to\nthose who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses\nexercised to discern both good and evil.\u201d Paul used the verb several times in\n1 Corinthians. For instance, he used diakreisis in questioning whether the\nchurch had anyone wise enough to \u201cjudge between his brethren\u201d (1 Cor. 6:5).\nLater Paul used the word to reproach the Corinthian church for \u201cnot discern-\ning the Lord\u2019s body\u201d (1 Cor. 11:29). The gift of discerning of spirits is the\ncapacity to discern or judge the source of a spiritual manifestation whether\nit is the Holy Spirit, an evil spirit or merely the human spirit. Paul wrote:\n\u201cLet two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge [diakrino]\u201d (1 Cor.\n14:29). This seems to imply that the gift of discernment will be present when\nthe gift of prophecy is used. Apparently, in Corinth, the gift of discernment\nwas as common as that of prophecy (\u201clet the others judge\u201d).\nUltimately, all Spirit-filled believers are able to judge the operation of\nvocal gifts based on whether or not they are spiritually edifying to the body.\nIndividuals are not infallible in their exercise of gifts. For instance, if a speak-\ner\u2019s utterance (prophecy or interpretation of tongues) is not received by oth-\ners, he or she should not be discouraged but should humbly pray for more\nwisdom in exercising and discerning the gifts of the Spirit. Believers should\n\nfollow the admonition of Paul: \u201cDo not quench the Spirit. Do not despise\nprophecies. Test all things; hold fast what is good\u201d (1 Thess. 5:19-20). Solid\nbiblical teaching on spiritual gifts will lead to mature and appropriate expres-\nsions without creating a fear or distrust that quenches the Holy Spirit\u2019s work\nwithin the body of Christ. It is important to note that the discerning of spirits\nis not the judging of people but the judging of the spirit behind the mani-\nfestation. It is the process of discerning whether a manifestation is divine,\nsatanic or human.\n8. Kinds of tongues\nIn the Greek, \u201ckinds of tongues\u201d is gene glosson. The term \u201ckinds\u201d refers\nto the fact that there are \u201cnew tongues\u201d and \u201ctongues of men and of angels\u201d\n(1 Cor. 13:1). Some tongues are human languages, such as on the Day of\nPentecost when the multitude each heard in their \u201cown tongues the wonder-\nful works of God\u201d to show that the gospel was for all races and nations (Acts\n2:5-21). Other tongues are of heavenly origin and are used for praise and\nprayer that supersedes the constraints of the mind (1 Cor. 14:2; Rom. 8:26-\n27). It is said that he who speaks in this \u201ctongue does not speak to men but to\nGod, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries\u201d\n(1 Cor. 14:2). It is very important to observe that there are different uses of\ntongues. Paul A. Hamar, in his commentary on 1 Corinthians, remarked:\n\u201cThere is an acknowledged difference between tongues as the evidence of the\nbaptism of the Holy Spirit and in individual praying, and tongues as a gift\n(as used here). The difference is basically one of purpose: one is to edify one\u2019s\nown spirit; the other to edify the congregation.\u201d20\nThe personal prayer language of tongues is given to every believer who is\nbaptized with the Holy Spirit. It is provided to evidence Spirit baptism and to\ngive believers the ability to pray, sing and praise God in the Spirit. Although\neveryone baptized with the Holy Spirit has the evidence of tongues as a prayer\nlanguage, not everyone has the gift of tongues and interpretation in the con-\ngregational setting. When Paul asked, \u201cDo all speak in tongues?\u201d he was\nspeaking of tongues as the congregational gift accompanied by interpretation\n20 Paul A. Hamar, The Radiant Commentary on the New Testament, The Book of First Corinthians (Springfield, MO:\nGospel Publishing House, 1980).\n\n(1 Cor. 12:30). He was not speaking about the personal prayer language of\ntongues that is available to every believer baptized with the Holy Spirit.\nUnlike private tongues speaking, the public proclamation of tongues\nwithin a congregational setting must be interpreted. If no interpreter is pres-\nent, the one with the gift of tongues should remain silent or pray for the\naccompanying gift of the interpretation of tongues. If tongues speakers do\nnot know whether an interpreter is present, they must be ready to interpret\ntheir own utterances (1 Cor. 14:13, 28).\nThe following is a summary of the discernibly different uses of speaking\nin tongues:\n(1) The initial physical evidence of the baptism with the Holy Spirit\n(Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6)\n(2) Tongues as a prayer language that transcends the mind and allows\nthe spirit to commune directly with God (Rom. 8:26-27; 1 Cor. 14:2,\n14-15)\n(3) Tongues with interpretation for the spiritual edification of the\nchurch body (1 Cor. 14:5, 26-28)\n(4) Tongues together with interpretation as a \u201csign\u201d to the unbeliever\n(1 Cor. 14:22) Note: This may be a sign to unbelievers because they\nsense the presence of God or they actually hear their language spoken in\nthe tongues.\n9. Interpretation of tongues\nThe word \u201cinterpretation\u201d translates the Greek word hermeneia, from\nwhich is derived the English word \u201chermeneutics\u201d (the science of inter-\npretation). The Greek word means \u201ctranslation, explanation or interpreta-\ntion.\u201d The verb form of the word is used several times to mean \u201ctranslation\u201d\n\n(John 1:38, 42; 9:7; Heb. 7:2). The noun form hermeneia is found only in 1\nCorinthians 12 and 14 where it is used in association with tongues. The basic\nmeaning of the word suggests the idea of \u201cexplanation\u201d or \u201cinterpretation.\u201d\nConsequently, the interpretation of an utterance in tongues is an explanation\nof the tongues\u2019 meaning, not a literal word-for-word translation. Since it is\nan explanation, it will most likely vary in length from the tongue being inter-\npreted. When the gift of tongues is exercised for the edification of the church\nor as a sign gift, interpretation is essential. Paul seemed to limit the gift of\ntongues to personal prayer language unless accompanied by interpretation (1\nCor. 14:13, 27-28). Those who have the gift of tongues are encouraged to\npray for the gift of interpretation (1 Cor. 14:13).\n10. Helps\nThe nine gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 do not constitute the\ntotal number of charismata. Later in the same chapter, Paul introduced the\ncharismata of helps and administrations (1 Cor. 12:28). The word \u201chelps\u201d\ncomes from the Greek word antilepsis, which is used only once in the New\nTestament. Antilepsis\u2019 verb form, antilambano, occurs in three passages. One\nof these passages gives a good indication of how the helps gift is expressed:\n\u201cI have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support\n[antilambano] the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He\nsaid, \u2018It is more blessed to give than to receive\u2019\u201d (Acts 20:35). In this passage,\nPaul instructed the Ephesian elders on how to care for the Ephesian church.\nHe told them that after he departed, they were to carry on a ministry of\n\u201chelps\u201d (antilambano) for the benefit of those who were weak physically and\nfinancially. In this context, the helps gift seems to be associated with helping\nthe sick and financially needy.\nIt seems that believers need the gift of helps to most effectively minister\nto the sick and poor. Prolonged, impactful ministry to the needy and afflicted\nrequires a deep, spiritual burden and a God-given love. Human compassion\nis important, but a divine call and the Spirit\u2019s anointing are crucial to keep\nthe helper from becoming discouraged or critical. Although all believers are\ncalled to help those in need, the gift of helps seems to be a special gift for\n\nministering to those who are weak or have deep need. For every kind of spir-\nitual work, God has supplied a corresponding spiritual gift.\n11. Administrations\n\u201cAdministrations\u201d comes from the Greek word kubernesis. As in the case\nof the gift of helps, administrations (kubernesis) is found only once in the\nNew Testament. However, the noun form kubernetes occurs twice, referring\neach time to a shipmaster (Acts 27:11; Rev. 18:17). The verb form means\n\u201cto steer or to be a helmsman.\u201d In this context, the gift of administrations\nwould seem to describe a spiritual capacity given to leaders to steer the church\nor individuals through storms and difficult seas. On the basis of 1 Timothy\n5:17, some have reasoned that there were two classes of elders in the church:\nteaching elders and ruling elders. They suggest that the elders who did not\nminister the word may have exercised their ministry in the business and struc-\ntural affairs of the church. It would seem that the gift of administrations\nwould be crucial to keep churches on an even keel.\nE. Special instructions on the gifts of tongues and prophecy\nFirst Corinthians 14 was written to instruct Christians on the proper\nuse of spiritual gifts, especially the vocal gifts of tongues, interpretation of\ntongues and prophecy. Some have inferred that Paul wrote to the Corinthians\nto discourage the use of tongues. However, Paul would certainly not have\nsaid, \u201cI wish you all spoke in tongues\u2026\u201d if he had wanted to discourage the\npractice (v. 5). The apostle who said, \u201cI thank my God I speak with tongues\nmore than you all\u201d (v. 18) was not writing to prohibit tongues but to discour-\nage the expression of uninterpreted tongues in public meetings. Paul wanted\nall believers to use tongues as a prayer language (vv. 2-4). However, it seems\nthe Corinthians thought that when the Spirit moved, they were expected\nto exercise their gift even if they all spoke at once without interpretation or\nregard for unbelievers in their midst. They did not know that the spirit of a\ngifted person is still subject to his or her personal control (v. 32). They over-\nlooked the fact that God gives believers endowments to use intelligently, in\naccordance with Scripture and for the sole purpose of the spiritual edification\n\nof the whole body. They didn\u2019t realize that the gifts must not be used selfishly,\nostentatiously or without love because spiritual gifts actually belong to the\nchurch more than they belong to the individual (1 Cor. 13). Ultimately, the\nuse of the vocal gifts among members of the body must also accompany the\nteaching of the Bible and the preaching of the gospel (vv. 27-29). The gifts are\na great blessing when they are in submission to sound biblical teaching and\nwise spiritual leadership.\n1. The importance of tongues and prophecy\nIn 1 Corinthians 14 Paul wrote: \u201cTherefore, brethren, desire earnestly\nto prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues\u201d (v. 39). The tongues\nreferred to here seem to be with interpretation, for Paul had already forbidden\nthe Corinthians from speaking in tongues in a public service without inter-\npretation: \u201cBut if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let\nhim speak to himself and to God\u201d (v. 28). Tongues with interpretation and\nprophecy are to be desired and encouraged in public services. Both prophecy\nand tongues with interpretation are to be expressed for the purpose of edify-\ning, exhorting and comforting the church.\n2. The private use of tongues\nThe most prevalent use of tongues is tongues as a prayer language (1 Cor.\n14:2, 14-15; Rom. 8:26-27). Some suggest Jesus spoke in tongues inwardly\nwhen He prayed for the deaf and mute man in Mark 7:34. This is because\nthe Mark passage uses the same Greek word stenazo that is translated \u201cgroan-\nings that cannot be uttered\u201d in Romans 8:26. Prayer in tongues should be\nthe normal practice of every Spirit-filled Christian. Believers are commanded\nto pray: \u201c\u2026praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit ...\u201d\n(Eph. 6:18; see also Eph. 5:18-19). Prayer in the Spirit promotes a deepening\nof a person\u2019s prayer life and the spiritual development of one\u2019s personality.\nSome critics of tongues have inferred that tongues speaking may be unsettling\nto the mind. However, psychological studies have shown that tongues speak-\ning tends to integrate and solidify the personality and make possessors of the\n\ngift more able to cope with life\u2019s problems.21 Paul suggested that the Spirit\n\u201chelps in our weaknesses\u201d when \u201cwe do not know what we should pray.\u201d The\nSpirit \u201cHimself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be\nuttered\u201d (Rom. 8:26-27), accomplishing intercession on a higher level than\nthat of our conscious petitioning.\n3. Prayer and praise in the Spirit\nMuch has already been written on this aspect of tongues as a Spirit-\nprovided vehicle for individual prayer and praise. However, there is also an\nexercise of tongues in prayer and singing in the Spirit that calls for interpreta-\ntion. \u201cWhat is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also\npray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing\nwith the understanding\u201d (1 Cor 14:15). First Corinthians 14:16 indicates\nthat this is ministry to the body: \u201cOtherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how\nwill he who occupies the place of the uninformed say \u2018Amen\u2019 at your giving\nof thanks, since he does not understand what you say?\u201d This exercise seems to\ndiffer from tongues as a private prayer language as described in 1 Corinthians\n14:14 and 14:28.\n4. Limitations on tongues and prophesying\nApparently, the meetings in Corinth gave so much time to specific, vocal\ngifts, especially tongues speaking both with and without interpretation, that\nother ministry was reduced or eliminated. First Corinthians 14 was written\nto put vocal gifts in proper perspective and to teach on the mature exercise of\nthe gifts. In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, Paul emphasized the need for variety in the\ndistribution of gifts. If all the gifts are to be exercised, and if all believers are to\nexercise some gift (1 Cor. 12:11), the vocal gifts should not occupy the whole\nservice. Prophecy and tongues with interpretation, exercised in scriptural\norder, are very edifying. However, along with these gifts there should also be\nanointed teaching, preaching and other ministries. This is most likely why\nPaul wrote that utterances with tongues should be limited to two or three\n21 See Arnold Bittlinger, Gifts and Graces (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company,\n1967) 101; Morton J. Kelsey, Speaking with Tongues I (New York: Doubleday Publishing Company, 1965).\n\nwith proper interpretation. Likewise, prophesying should also be restricted\nto two or three in any one gathering. Supernatural utterances must not be so\nnumerous that they take over the service and overwhelm the listeners. This\nmay have happened in Thessalonica, prompting Paul to write the warning,\n\u201cDo not despise prophecies\u201d (1 Thess. 5:19-20).\nPaul\u2019s instructions in 1 Corinthians 14 concerning the vocal gifts demon-\nstrate that they can be exercised in an ordered way: \u201cAnd the spirits of the\nprophets are subject to the prophets\u201d (1 Cor. 14:32). He added: \u201cFor God is\nnot the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints\u201d\n(1 Cor. 14:33). Everyone who exercises vocal gifts should pray for the wisdom\nto recognize when their utterance is edifying. Only on rare occasions should\nother ministry be interrupted by an utterance. There should be enough pauses\nwithin a service for a gift of edification to be exercised without the need for\nanyone to be interrupted. There may be exceptions, but they are rare.\n5. Not to be considered infallible\nAnother principle for the exercise of the gifts is that no operation expressed\nthrough human instruments is infallible. The gift of the discerning of spirits\nshould operate in every assembly where the gifts are exercised. This does not\nmean individuals must make a public pronouncement of judgment concern-\ning every expression of a vocal gift. Paul wrote: \u201cLet two or three prophets\nspeak, and let the others judge\u201d (1 Cor. 14:29). All Spirit-filled believers have\nsome ability to judge whether utterances are spiritually edifying. If all are\nto discern, then it must be that every person discerns whether the utterance\nhas spiritual value for his or her life. If the prophetic word has value and\napplication for specific individuals, then those individuals should receive the\nmessage and act upon it in their own lives. Not all messages are meant to\napply to every person present. If the utterance is totally from a human spirit\nand unedifying, then one with the gift of discernment may declare it unprof-\nitable. If the utterance is from an evil spirit, then it should be denounced\nand corrected. Words discerned to be from the Lord should be affirmed and\nencouraged. Leadership should covet the gift of discernment. \u201cPursue love,\nand desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy\u201d (1 Cor. 14:1).\n\nF. The gifts of the Spirit listed in Romans 12\n1. Prophecy\nIn the study of 1 Corinthians 12, at least eleven gifts were identified,\nand three of the ministry gifts were briefly mentioned (ministry gifts will be\naddressed in the next section). Prophecy is the only gift common to both the\nCorinthian and Roman gift lists. This might mean that prophecy was the\nprimary vocal gift exercised in Rome or that the other vocal gifts were simply\nnot mentioned in Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans. Regardless, since prophecy is\nthe vocal gift of preference, it certainly accomplished the purpose of edifying,\nexhorting and comforting the church in Rome. In the Romans gift list, Paul\nadded that \u201cfaith\u201d is the operational principle underlying prophecy, and that\nprophecy must be exercised in proportion to the measure of one\u2019s faith. This\n\u201cfaith\u201d is not the saving faith that all possess as a gift but rather the faith asso-\nciated with works of power (Matt. 9:29).\n2. Ministry\nTo the church at Rome, Paul mentioned the gift of \u201cministry\u201d (diakonia)\nwhich probably included a number of gifts. Paul wrote to the Corinthian\nchurch: \u201cThere are differences of ministries, but the same Lord\u201d (1 Cor.\n12:5). This suggests that all gifts are ministries or vehicles of service to the\nbody. After mentioning \u201cprophecy\u201d and \u201cministry,\u201d Paul turned the focus\naway from the gifts to the persons who exercise the gifts.\n3. Teachers and their teaching\nGod does not impart gifts for selfish acquisition, but He gives gifts so that\nindividuals can minister the purposes of God to each other and spiritually\nbuild up the church. When God provides the teaching of divine truth, He\nactually gives two gifts. He gives to the church a teacher as well as the gift of\nteaching. Teachers are of little value unless they exercise their teaching gift.\nIn Romans 12:7, Paul is saying in effect, \u201cIf individuals are God-anointed\nteachers, let them use their gift to teach.\u201d In other words, the proof that a\nperson is a teacher is seen in the fact that he or she is practicing constructive\n\nteaching. Ministers do not demonstrate their gifting in their titles but in their\nministry. What authenticates God-ordained teachers are students who grow\nin grace and knowledge under their teaching (1 Cor. 2:10-16; 1 Tim. 5:17; 2\nTim. 2:2; 1 John 2:20, 27).\n4. Exhorters and their exhortations\nPaul wrote that exhortation (paraklesis) is one of the exercises of the\nprophet (1 Cor. 14:3). Since \u201che who exhorts\u201d is mentioned here (Rom.\n12:8) separate from the one who prophesies (Rom. 12:6), it would appear\nthat there were those in Rome who were known as \u201cexhorters.\u201d Barnabas\nwas called \u201cthe son of exhortation [paraklesis]\u201d (Acts 4:36, ASV). Since Paul\nfrequently used the verb \u201cto exhort\u201d in the sense of \u201cto implore, to urge, to\nbeseech or to entreat\u201d (see Rom. 12:1), the work of the \u201cexhorter\u201d was prob-\nably that of arousing and motivating the church to patient endurance, broth-\nerly love and good works. The author of Hebrews was an exhorter when\nhe implored:\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without\nwavering, for He who promised is faithful. And let\nus consider one another in order to stir up love and\ngood works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves\ntogether, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one\nanother, and so much the more as you see the Day\napproaching (Heb. 10:23-25).\nSome religious groups recognize an office of the exhorter and grant a\ncorresponding ministerial credential (see Acts 9:31; 11:23; 14:22; 15:31-32;\n16:40; 20:2; 1 Thess. 5:14-22).\n5. Givers and their liberality\nIn the church, there are those who have a gift of \u201cgiving.\u201d This is not one\nwho administers the charities of the church. Rather, givers are individuals\nwho share with others their own possessions with great liberality. \u201cHe who\n\ngives\u201d translates the Greek ho metadidous. The term is found in Ephesians\n4:28: \u201cLet him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working\nwith his hands what is good, that he may have something to give [metadido-\nnai] him who has need.\u201d The same word is used in Luke 3:11 in reference to\nthe preaching of John the Baptist: \u201cHe answered and said to them, \u2018He who\nhas two tunics, let him give [metadoto] to him who has none; and he who\nhas food, let him do likewise.\u2019\u201d This is not institutional giving but personal\nsharing. These gifted givers may channel their gifts through the church, but\nthey are more than officials who distribute the gifts of others. They are givers\nof their own things who, motivated by the Holy Spirit, give with extraordi-\nnary generosity.\nAn example of such giving is found in 2 Corinthians 8. Paul, writing\nabout a collection for the poor, said: \u201cMoreover, brethren, we make known to\nyou the grace [charis] of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: that\nin a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty\nabounded in the riches of their liberality\u2026And not only as we had hoped, but\nthey first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God\u201d (2\nCor. 8:1-5). Then, using the Macedonian churches (Philippi, Thessalonica,\nBerea) as an example, he urged the Corinthians (the gifted church) to mani-\nfest the same gift of giving for the poor. He said further: \u201cBut as you abound\nin everything\u2014in faith, in speech, in knowledge\u2026see that you abound in this\ngrace also\u201d (2 Cor. 8:7). Paul used the word \u201cgrace\u201d (charis) here in the same\nsense as the word \u201cgift\u201d (charisma). He called the gifts (charismata) which the\nCorinthian church possessed \u201cgraces.\u201d W. E. Vine gave one of the meanings\nof \u201cgrace\u201d as \u201cthe power and equipment for ministry.\u201d22 This definition of\n\u201cgrace\u201d as a spiritual gift is exemplified by Paul\u2019s statement in 1 Corinthians\n1:4-7: \u201cI thank my God\u2026for the grace of God which was given to you by\nChrist Jesus, that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance\nand all knowledge\u2026so that you come short in no gift [charisma], eagerly\nwaiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d All believers, out of\nlove, compassion and a sense of responsibility to Christ\u2019s kingdom, will give\nto the church and to the needy. Beyond this normal giving, there are those\nwho, gifted by the Holy Spirit, give with extraordinary liberality, even when\nfacing affliction and poverty.\n22 W.E. Vine, \u201cGrace,\u201d An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words (Fleming H. Revell, 1956) 170.\n\n6. Leaders and their diligence\nPaul hinted in 1 Timothy 5:17 that there were church elders other than\nthose who ministered the word of God. The church needs a number of different\nkinds of leadership. In Romans 12:8 (NIV), Paul wrote: \u201cif it [a person\u2019s gift]\nis to lead, do it diligently\u2026\u201d The same Greek word translated \u201che who leads\u201d\n(ho proistamenos) in Romans 12:8, is found in 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13: \u201cAnd\nwe urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over\nyou in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love for\ntheir work\u2019s sake.\u201d Many of God\u2019s faithful servants occupy executive positions\nof leadership, administration, management of funds, personnel guidance, strat-\negy planning and missionary oversight. These positions might be seen as being\noutside the realm of the Holy Spirit\u2019s moving. But in fact, these leaders need\nthe Holy Spirit\u2019s endowments as much as those who preach or teach. Believers\nshould pray constantly that their leaders, including their pastors, enjoy a pow-\nerful anointing of the Spirit upon their offices (2 Cor. 1:11; Eph. 6:18-20; Col.\n2:2-4; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24; 1 Tim. 2:1-3).\nSome believe the gift of leadership listed in Romans 12:8 is the same as\nthe gift of \u201cgovernments\u201d mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:28. This is possible;\nhowever, different Greek words with different basic meanings are employed\nin each passage. The gift listed in Romans 12:8 has the meaning of \u201cbeing\nover\u201d others as their leader, while that in 1 Corinthians 12:28 has more the\nmeaning of guidance through all kinds of seas (a helmsman). Both kinds of\nleadership are needed in the church, and one person very well might have\nboth capacities. It is encouraging to know that the leaders of Christ\u2019s church\ndo not have to exercise their offices with mere human wisdom and ability.\nPaul declared that the characteristic virtue of spiritual leadership is \u201cdili-\ngence.\u201d Perhaps he was describing this diligence in 2 Corinthians 11:28 when\nhe spoke of his \u201cconcern for all the churches\u201d (see also 2 Tim. 2:15).\n7. Those who show mercy and their cheerfulness\nIt is quite possible that the gift described here in Romans 12:8 as \u201che who\nshows mercy,\u201d may be the same gift listed in 1 Corinthians 12:28 as \u201chelps.\u201d\nThe Greek word for \u201chave mercy\u201d is eleo, which is defined as \u201cto have pity,\n\nmercy or compassion on.\u201d Mercy is an attribute of God: \u201cBut God, who is\nrich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us\u2026\u201d (Eph.\n2:4). The sick who cried out to Jesus exclaimed, \u201cHave mercy on me!\u201d (Mark\n10:47). It would seem that the gift of showing mercy is a ministry of care for\nthe sick and afflicted by means of visitation and prayer. Consequently, \u201cgifts\nof healings\u201d are probably exercised by those who also have the ministry of\nshowing mercy. All believers have some responsibility to show mercies to the\npoor and afflicted, but there are those who are uniquely gifted by the Lord\nto carry out works of compassion as an anointed ministry. There are those,\nwho by the Spirit\u2019s anointing, are \u201ccheerful givers\u201d who share readily with the\nneedy (2 Cor. 9:7). There are others with a different gift who share their love,\ncompassion, time and presence to heal and restore the poor and afflicted. It\nis fitting that the God of all mercy and compassion places such gifted people\nin the body of Christ. It is also comforting to know that God has blessed a\nvariety of Spirit-anointed gifts and ministries to meet the needs of every indi-\nvidual, community and situation.\nG. The ministry gifts\nThe apostle Paul, writing to the Ephesian church, declared a remarkable\ntruth concerning the spiritual leaders in the body of Christ:\nBut to each one of us grace was given according to the\nmeasure of Christ\u2019s gift. Therefore He says: \u201cWhen He\nascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave\ngifts to men.\u201d\u2026And He Himself gave some to be apos-\ntles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors\nand teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the\nwork of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ\n(Eph. 4:7-12).\nThe remarkable truth is that spiritual offices in the church are to be thought\nof as gifts from Christ to His body. Therefore, humans cannot make them-\nselves leaders or be made leaders by the whim of others (Rom. 1:5; 1 Cor. 1:1;\n2 Cor. 1:1; Gal. 1:1, 15-16). The church must set apart as spiritual leaders and\nministers those whom God has called and chosen (Acts 13:1-3). When Christ\n\ngives individuals to the body of Christ, He endows them with spiritual gifts\nthat correspond to their offices. Some Bible teachers draw a sharp distinction\nbetween the ministry gifts and the charismata, contending that the former are\ngifts of Christ while the charismata are gifts of the Spirit (pneumatika). That all\ndivine offices and enablements are ultimately gifts from our triune God is seen\nin Paul\u2019s introduction to the charismata: \u201cThere are diversities of gifts, but the\nsame Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there\nare diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all\u201d (1 Cor.\n12:4-6). Furthermore, Paul intermingled the offices of apostle, prophet and\nteacher along with endowments in his summary of the charismata: \u201cAnd God\nhas appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teach-\ners, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties\nof tongues\u201d (1 Cor. 12:28). In the Romans 12 passage, Paul listed seven gifts,\nmixing two gifts (charismata) with five kinds of possessors of gifts. These pas-\nsages demonstrate that all divinely-ordained humans are given gifts of enable-\nment, and all spiritual gifts equip for some kind of ministry. Of course, not\nevery exercise of a gift makes someone a leader (Acts 20:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Thess.\n5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24; 1 Pet. 5:1-4). However, whether leaders\nor followers, there are spiritual gifts that divinely equip believers to do God\u2019s\nwork. The Bible does not describe a wide gulf between leaders and believers.\nNevertheless, the offices of the church are divine gifts that mature, direct and\nprotect the church from error. The offices and their endowments are as follows:\n1. Apostle\nThe apostles were the first leaders of the church, first in time (Matt.\n10:1-2; Luke 22:14-15; Eph. 2:20), first in authority (Mark 6:7; Acts 1:21-\n26), first in ministry (Acts 2:37; 6:1-4) and first in the scriptural lists (1 Cor.\n12:28; Eph. 4:11). The apostles were those commissioned and sent forth by\nJesus to initiate and direct the preaching and teaching of the gospel and,\ntogether with Him, to found the church (Eph. 2:20; Rev. 21:14).\nThe title \u201capostle\u201d comes from the Greek word apostolos, which means\n\u201ca messenger, one sent with a commission, an apostle of Christ.\u201d The basic\nidea expressed by the word \u201capostle\u201d is that of one sent as a representative of\n\nanother and who derives his or her authority from that sender. In the classical\nGreek, apostolos also meant \u201ca fleet of ships or expedition.\u201d The meaning is\nextended to \u201cone commissioned and sent to another country,\u201d such as a mis-\nsionary. The verb apostello means to \u201csend from or away.\u201d\nThe first group to be called apostles in the New Testament were the twelve\ndisciples of Jesus (Matt. 10:2; Luke 6:13). In addition to the twelve, several\nothers were called apostles: Barnabas (Acts 14:14), Silas and Timothy (1 Thess.\n2:6), James (1 Cor. 15:7), Paul (Rom. 1:1) and probably Andronicus and\nJunias (Rom. 16:7). The last two, who were Paul\u2019s kinsmen, are referred to in\n2 Corinthians 8:23 as \u201cmessengers [apostolos] of the churches.\u201d Epaphroditus\nis called, by Paul, the messenger (apostolos) of the Philippian church (Phil.\n2:25). It appears that the term \u201capostle\u201d was used with several different mean-\nings: (1) the twelve apostles of Jesus (Matt. 10:2; 19:28; Luke 22:14); (2) all\nthose commissioned by Jesus, possibly the 70 sent out in Luke 10:1 and the\n120 in Acts 1:15 (see also 1 Cor. 15:5-7); (3) Paul as a special apostle to the\nGentiles (Gal. 2:7-9), and (4) certain associates of Paul in his ministry to the\nnations (Acts 14:14; Rom. 16:7).\nDifferent levels of apostleship seem to be set forth in 1 Corinthians\n15:4-10:\n\u2026He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\nand that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve\u2026\nAfter that He was seen by James, then by all the apos-\ntles. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one\nborn out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles,\nwho am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I\npersecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God\nI am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in\nvain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet\nnot I, but the grace of God which was with me.\nA comparison between 1 Corinthians 15:5 and 15:7 shows that Paul\nmade a clear distinction between \u201cthe twelve\u201d (v. 5) and \u201call of the apostles\u201d\n(v. 7). Grosheide commented on verse seven: \u201cThere is thus an analogy with\n\nverse five: there it was Peter first and then the twelve; here James first and then\na greater circle of apostles.\u201d23\nFinally, Paul referred to himself as the last and the least of all the apostles.\nIn this context, it seems Paul defined apostles as men who had seen the Lord\nJesus (see 1 Cor. 9:1). If Paul is the \u201clast of all\u201d the apostles, then there cannot\nbe apostles such as he was in later times. The larger circle of apostles probably\nincluded the 70 Jesus personally commissioned, or even the 120 who received\nthe Spirit\u2019s fullness on the Day of Pentecost. That these latter apostles were not\nconsidered to be on the same level with \u201cthe twelve\u201d is supported by passages\nsuch as Acts 1:22-26 and Revelation 21:14. Barnabas, Silas, Andronicus and\nJunias could well have been among the 70 or the 120 who were witnesses\nto Jesus\u2019 resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). Paul seemed to class himself in a third\ncategory of apostles \u201cborn out of due time,\u201d one to whom the risen Lord had\nappeared after His ascension (1 Cor. 15:8). Paul had seen the Lord (1 Cor.\n9:1); the signs of an apostle had appeared in his ministry (2 Cor. 12:12); he\nhad received the right hand of fellowship from the original Jerusalem apostles\n(Gal. 2:9), and he had authority from them to carry the gospel to the Gentiles.\nSubsequent history demonstrated Paul\u2019s apostleship in that he was used\nof the Lord to pen more books of the New Testament than any other human\nauthor. Yet, the fact that Paul was forced to contend so strongly for his own\napostleship shows that the early church had set exceedingly high qualifications\nfor the office of an apostle (1 Cor. 9:1; 2 Cor. 12:11-12). Those who claimed\napostleship falsely were strongly condemned (2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2). The\napostles are called the foundation of the church; a structure can have only\none foundation (Eph. 2:20). Around Paul at Antioch, a circle was formed\nof men such as Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, Titus and Epaphroditus who were\ncalled apostles because they were commissioned by the church at Antioch to\nbe \u201cmissionaries\u201d (another meaning of the word apostolos). In this missionary\nsense, there have been apostles in every age of the church: individuals with\nmighty gifts of the Spirit, who through the power of the risen Christ have\npushed the frontiers of the church to the ends of the earth. Even if they have\nnot called themselves \u201capostles,\u201d they have done the work and produced the\n23 Frederick Willem Grosheide, New International Commentary on the New Testament, First Corinthians\n(Grand Rapids, MI: Win. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1953) 352.\n\nfruit of apostles. The title of apostle seems to belong to the first generation of\nthe church; however, the spiritual endowments needed for apostolic work will\ncontinue to be poured out as long as there are unreached peoples on the face\nof the earth. Jesus is still sending forth, with a commission, individuals who\nare given His authority over powers of darkness, who have authority to bind\nand loose, and who preach the gospel with the anointing of a prophet. This\napostolic work continues among us today.\n2. Prophet\nThe prophet, which Paul also listed among the ministry gifts to the church\n(Eph. 4:11), is second in importance only to the apostles. In the New Testament,\nthe prophet was an individual who not only exercised the gift of prophecy, but\nalso occupied a place of leadership ministry along with the apostles and teachers\n(Acts 11:27; 13:1-3; 15:32; Eph. 2:20; 3:5).\nIn the early New Testament church, there were two classifications\nof prophets. Any member of the general body of believers could minister\nedification, exhortation and comfort through the gift of prophecy (1 Cor.\n14:24, 31), but there was another classification consisting of such individuals\nas Barnabas, Silas, Judas, Agabus and others mentioned in Acts 13:1 who\nwere considered to be a part of the spiritual leadership (Acts 21:22). They\nare referred to by Paul in Ephesians 4:11 as among the ministry gifts to the\nchurch. Although those of the latter group exercised the same gift of proph-\necy, they also possessed an additional charisma of leadership. The following\nare ways the gift of prophecy operates in and through those who exercise it:\na) The prophet speaks as the Lord\u2019s agent. Prophets speak that which\nthe Lord wills them to speak. Peter defined the function of the prophet\nas follows: \u201cAs each one has received a gift [charisma], minister it to one\nanother, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If anyone speaks,\nlet him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as\nwith the ability which God supplies\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 4:10-11). In all gifted\nministry there is a supernatural element.\n\nb) Often the content of the prophet\u2019s message will be given extem-\nporaneously at the time of speaking. However, the message may be given\nbeforehand during prayer or meditation. Many of the Old Testament\nprophets received their prophecies in dreams, visions or prayers, and\ndelivered these messages to the people at a later date (Isa. 6:9-13).\nc) Sometimes the content of the prophecy may consist of data well\nknown to the prophet, such as scriptural truth or history. Peter on the day\nof Pentecost (Acts 2:14-37) and Stephen before the Sanhedrin (Acts 7)\nboth delivered prophetic messages that were filled with quotations from\nthe Old Testament. It is clear from the accounts in Acts that both spoke\nin the power of the Spirit. The word used to describe Peter\u2019s utterance\nin 2:14 is apophthengomai, the same word used in the clause \u201cand began\nto speak with other tongues\u201d in Acts 2:4. It is a term used to express the\nspeech of prophets, seers and oracles. Stephen concluded his message\nwith a vision of Christ \u201cstanding at the right hand of God\u201d (Acts 7:56).\nIt appears from these examples that prophets may employ scripture in\ntheir messages as the Holy Spirit directs them in the choice of material\nand in the application of those scriptures to specific situations. A prophet\nmay be moved strongly by the Spirit to proclaim a certain scriptural pas-\nsage where the Spirit also provides a special boldness and power of com-\nmunication: \u201c\u2026and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they\nspoke the word of God with boldness [parresia]\u201d (Acts 4:31; see also Eph.\n6:18-20).\nNot all preaching is prophecy, but preaching becomes prophetic\nwhen great, unpremeditated truth or application is provided by the\nSpirit, or when special revelation is given beforehand in prayer and is\nempowered in the delivery. When a person speaks in tongues, the mind\nis inactive (1 Cor. 14:14), but when a person prophesies, the Spirit oper-\nates through the mind to supply a message: \u201c\u2026yet in the church I would\nrather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others\nalso, than ten thousand words in a tongue\u201d (1 Cor. 14:19). Here, Paul\nwas not contrasting gifted utterance with non-gifted speech. Instead he\nwas contrasting tongues with prophecy. First Corinthians 14 was written\n\nspecifically to deal with the similarities and differences between tongues\nand prophecy.\nd) Before the New Testament was written, many of the apostolic\nprophets were used of the Spirit to reveal the gospel plan of salvation, for\nit was only dimly prefigured in the typology of the Old Testament (Eph.\n2:20). This prophetic revelation was later written down in the epistles:\n\u201c\u2026by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the\nmystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known to the sons\nof men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and\nprophets\u2026\u201d (Eph. 3:4-5).\ne) While prophecy is more \u201cforthtelling\u201d than it is \u201cforetelling,\u201d\nsometimes it may involve prediction of the future. The book of Acts\nrecords two predictive prophecies of Agabus (Acts 11:27-28; 21:10-\n14). The first prophecy was relative to the impending famine in Judea,\nthe second pertained to Paul\u2019s soon coming imprisonment in Jerusalem.\nBoth prophecies were fulfilled. It should be noted, regarding the second\nprediction of Agabus, that Paul did not change his plans as a result of\nthe prophecy or the urging of his friends. This teaches that prophecy\nmay be given to reveal or confirm a coming event but is not provided\nlike a fortune teller for personal guidance. Paul respected the prophecy\nof Agabus which revealed only what Paul already knew (Acts 20:22-\n23). Although hearing Agabus\u2019 prophetic warning, Paul followed his\nown understanding of God\u2019s will for his future. God may reveal the\nfuture, but we are not to \u201cinquire of prophets\u201d concerning the future.\nThose who walk by faith live one day at a time leaving the unknown\nfuture to God.\nf) It is often asked whether prophetic utterances ought to be phrased\nin first person (\u201cI the Lord\u201d), or in third person (\u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d\nor \u201cThe Lord would have\u201d). When individuals exercise vocal gifts, they\nspeak as the Spirit supplies thoughts. In other words, the Spirit reveals,\nand the prophets speak. God reveals to prophets what He wants said. Paul\nsaid: \u201cLet two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge\u201d (1 Cor.\n14:29). Since the messages of the prophets are subject to being judged\n\nor discerned, it seems more consistent with humility for the prophet to\nspeak in the third person as Agabus did in Acts 21:11. Paul declared,\n\u201cthat the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord\u201d\n(1 Cor. 14:37). Even so, he expressed his precepts in the third person.\nLuke declared, concerning those who were filled with the Spirit on\nthe Day of Pentecost, that they \u201cbegan to speak with other tongues, as\nthe Spirit gave them utterance\u201d (Acts 2:4). God did not speak through\nthe believers with tongues; rather the believers spoke as they were enabled\nby the Spirit. God does not normally speak through humans as passive\nmegaphones. He reveals to prophets His will, enabling them to speak\nwhat He supplies. Often God spoke directly to the prophets, but when\nthe prophet delivered the message to the people, he said, \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord\u201d or an equivalent phrase. Prophetic utterances are best phrased\nin contemporary language rather than with archaic words except when\nactual scripture is quoted.\n3. Evangelist\n\u201cEvangelist\u201d comes from the Greek word euangelistes, which is defined\nas \u201cone who proclaims good news.\u201d The English word \u201cgospel\u201d translates\nanother form of the same Greek word. Evangelists are individuals who devote\nthemselves to \u201cpreaching the gospel,\u201d especially the message of salvation.\nThe term \u201cevangelist\u201d is used only three times in the New Testament (Acts\n21:8; Eph. 4:11; 2 Tim. 4:5). Nevertheless, Paul listed the evangelist as one\nof the ministry gifts to the church (Eph. 4:11). Only Philip was specifically\ncalled an \u201cevangelist\u201d (Acts 21:8); but workers such as Timothy (2 Tim. 4:5),\nLuke (2 Cor. 8:18), Clement (Phil. 4:3) and Epaphras (Col. 1:7; 4:12) may\nhave also functioned as evangelists. Paul\u2019s words to Timothy suggest that his\ntrue calling was that of the evangelist: \u201cPreach the word! Be ready in sea-\nson and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and\nteaching\u2026But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work\nof an evangelist, fulfill your ministry\u201d (2 Tim. 4:2-5; see also 1 Tim. 1:18;\n4:14). Paul clearly described an evangelist when he referred to an unnamed\nworker (most scholars identify him as Luke): \u201cAnd we have sent with him\n\nthe brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches\u2026\u201d (2\nCor. 8:18).\nThe clearest picture of an evangelist at work is found in Acts 8, which\ndescribes the ministry of Philip who was specifically called an \u201cevangelist\u201d\n(Acts 21:8). The following characteristics of Philip\u2019s ministry form a pattern\nof New Testament evangelism:\na) Philip preached the word of God, especially declaring the heart of\nthe gospel which is Christ the Savior. He \u201cpreached Christ unto them\u201d\n(Acts 8:4-5, 35).\nb) Many believed and were baptized (Acts 8:6, 12).\nc) Mighty miracles of healing followed Philip\u2019s preaching, and many\nwere delivered from demonic spirits (Acts 8:6-7). The healing miracles\ngave greater effectiveness to Philip\u2019s ministry (Acts 8:6-8).\nd) Philip was ready to witness about Christ as the Savior to whole cit-\nies or to one individual. Leaving Samaria, he was directed to the chariot\nof the treasurer of Ethiopia (Acts 8:27) whom he led to Christ (Acts 8:35-\n38). True evangelists have a passion for souls that makes them adaptable\nto mass evangelism or personal evangelism.\ne) Philip\u2019s evangelistic ministry took him from city to city (Acts 8:40).\nThe picture of the evangelist in the New Testament and post-apostolic\nperiod is that of an individual preaching the gospel message of salvation\nfrom church to church and from city to city. Eusebius, the great church\nhistorian of the fourth century, described evangelists: \u201cAnd they scattered\nthe saving seeds of the kingdom of heaven far and near throughout the\nwhole world\u2026Then starting out on long journeys they performed the\noffice of evangelists, being filled with the desire to preach Christ to those\nwho had not yet heard the word of faith\u201d24 (see Rom. 15:20-21).\n24 Eusebius, Church History, Vol. III, Chap. 37, pp. 1-2.\n\n4. Pastor-teacher\nIn the grammatical structure of Ephesians 4:11, the term \u201cteacher\u201d does\nnot have a definite article, unlike all of the other preceding terms for the\nministry gifts. Therefore, it seems \u201cteacher\u201d should be taken together with\n\u201cpastor.\u201d This does not mean that the terms are interchangeable. There may\nbe teachers who are not pastors, but there definitely cannot be pastors who\nare not teachers (Acts 20:28-30). In churches where there were several elders,\nsome might have had a ministry of leadership but were not teachers (1 Tim.\n5:17). Even so, the key pastors were teachers: \u201cThe elders who direct the\naffairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose\nwork is preaching and teaching\u201d (1 Tim. 5:17, NIV). One of the necessary\nqualifications for bishops (pastors/elders) was that they be \u201cable to teach\u201d\n(1 Tim. 3:2; 2 Tim. 2:24). A true pastor will have the charisma of teaching\n(Rom. 12:7; 1 Cor. 12:28).\nThe words \u201cpastor\u201d and \u201cshepherd\u201d come from the same Greek word\npoimen. The word \u201cpastor\u201d (poimen), used to refer to the spiritual leader of a\nlocal church, is found only once in the New Testament (Eph. 4:11). However,\nthe figure of the church as a \u201cflock\u201d (poimen) and of the work of the spiritual\nleader of the church as \u201cshepherding the flock of God\u201d (poimaino) is found\nseveral times (John 21:15-17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-4). The idea of Israel as\nthe flock of God and Yahweh as their shepherd is a common figure in the\nOld Testament (Ps. 23:1-4; 80:1-2; Isa. 40:11; Jer. 23:4; 25:34-38; Ezek. 34;\nZech. 11). In the New Testament, Jesus used the figure of the shepherd and\nthe sheep in John 10 where He calls Himself the \u201cGood Shepherd.\u201d In addi-\ntion to the title \u201cGood Shepherd,\u201d Jesus is also called the \u201cGreat Shepherd\u201d\n(Heb. 13:20), the \u201cChief Shepherd\u201d (1 Pet. 5:4) and the \u201cGentle Shepherd\u201d\n(Isa. 40:11). Pastors of the churches are ultimately \u201cunder-shepherds,\u201d serving\nunder the \u201cChief Shepherd.\u201d\nThe fact that teaching is mentioned in the Great Commission (Matt.\n28:19-20) shows the importance of the ministry of the teacher. The book of\nActs reinforces this observation: \u201cAnd daily in the temple, and in every house,\nthey did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ\u201d (Acts 5:42; see\nalso Acts 11:26; 13:1; 15:35; 20:20; 28:31; 1 Cor. 4:17; Col. 3:16; 2 Tim.\n\n2:2). In view of the importance of teaching, it is not surprising that one of the\nspecial endowments of the Holy Spirit is the capacity to teach. The proph-\nets inspired, exhorted, comforted and motivated the church. The teachers\ninstructed the church in sound doctrine, guarding the flock from false teach-\ners with destructive teachings. The church at Antioch enjoyed a balanced\nministry from prophets, evangelists and teachers. The apostle John referred\nto the anointing enjoyed by true teachers: \u201cBut you have an anointing from\nthe Holy One, and you know all things.\u201d (1 John 2:20; see also 1 John 2:27).\nThere is a tendency to think of the prophet as one who speaks supernaturally\nand of the teacher as one who imparts the findings of merely natural scholar-\nship. This is an inaccurate observation. The difference between prophet and\nteacher is not between the supernatural and the natural. Instead, it is a dif-\nference in the manner by which the Holy Spirit operates in the two ministry\ngifts. The anointing upon the prophet is often more sudden and impromptu\nwith the goal of motivation; the anointing upon the teacher is frequently\nmore measured, operating to illuminate God\u2019s truth and to give the ability to\ncommunicate accurately. For every ministry in the body of Christ there is a\nspiritual charisma.\nH. Other probable spiritual gifts\nThe lists of spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12 and Ephesians\n4 are not intended to be exhaustive. The following are phases of ministry that\nmay require a special endowment of the Holy Spirit:\n1. Hospitality\nPeter seemed to categorize \u201chospitality\u201d as a spiritual gift: \u201cBe hospitable\nto one another without grumbling. As each one has received a gift [charisma],\nminister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God\u201d\n(1 Pet. 4:9-10). Hospitality was very important to early Christians and was\na necessary qualification for bishops (1 Tim. 3:2). Although in the modern\nworld Christian workers are not normally entertained in people\u2019s homes,\nindividuals can still demonstrate hospitality by showing loving interest and\nconcern for others.\n\n2. Intercession\nA basic exercise of the Christian life is prayer. Prayer is to spiritual life\nwhat breathing is to physical life. However, prayer in the Spirit \u201cwith groan-\nings that cannot be uttered,\u201d is a charisma of the Spirit (Rom. 8:26-27).\nPrayer in the Spirit is available for all Spirit-filled believers, but most need\nto \u201cstir up the gift\u201d (1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). Perhaps prayer and praise in\nthe Spirit are aspects of the gift of tongues or interpretation of tongues. In\nany case, they are charismatic operations of the Spirit in the believer (1 Cor.\n14:15; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16).\n3. Witnessing\nWitnessing Christ to others is one of the primary goals of the church of\nJesus Christ. Jesus promised, \u201cBut you shall receive power when the Holy\nSpirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:8).\nThe Bible does not specifically refer to witnessing as a spiritual gift, but the\ncapacity to witness effectively is clearly declared to be the result of the out-\npouring of the Holy Spirit upon believers. Since there are many, like Paul,\nwho have a special ministry of witnessing, God may give a special endowment\nfor it: \u201cTherefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, wit-\nnessing both to small and great\u2026\u201d (Acts 26:22; see also Acts 23:11). Two pas-\nsages declare that witnessing is a special work of the Spirit: \u201cAnd we are His\nwitnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given\nto those who obey Him\u201d (Acts 5:32); \u201cAnd it is the Spirit who bears witness,\nbecause the Spirit is truth\u201d (1 John 5:6). It appears that the more individuals\nyield to the Spirit, the more they grow in their ability to witness effectively.\nI. Gifts for special abilities\nIn the Old Testament, special gifts of the Spirit were given to artisans\nwho served in the construction of the Tabernacle:\nAnd Moses said to the children of Israel, \u201cSee the Lord\nhas called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son\n\nof Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and He has filled him\nwith the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding,\nin knowledge and manner of workmanship, to design\nartistic works, to work in gold and silver and bronze\n... and to work in all manner of artistic workmanship\u201d\n(Exod. 35:30-33).\nGod supplied supernatural gifts for every skill needed in the building of\nthe Tabernacle. He also supplies in this age of spiritual enablement what is\nneeded to help His children worship Him. This may include the compos-\ning of spiritual music, the mastery of musical instruments that aid worship,\nthe writing of Christian literature that produces spiritual growth or even the\nbuilding of structures that serve for worship and teaching.\nIf anyone has a service that is useful to Christ\u2019s church, it should be\nexpected that God will endow that service with a special anointing so that no\nwork in Christ\u2019s body is done merely with human strength. \u201cIf anyone min-\nisters, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things\nGod may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the\ndominion forever and ever. Amen\u201d (1 Pet. 4:11).\nJ. The importance of love\nCritics of the operation of spiritual gifts sometimes say, \u201cI would rather\nhave love than tongues or miracles.\u201d Fortunately, they are not mutually exclu-\nsive alternatives. One does not have to choose between love and miracles, or\nbetween the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit. The Spirit bestows\nboth the fruit and the gifts; both are essential for a complete church. As men-\ntioned previously, love is an expression of the fruit of the Spirit. The great\n\u201clove chapter\u201d of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13, is positioned between the two\ngreat \u201cgift chapters.\u201d This is to demonstrate that love is not an alternative to\nthe gifts but is to be the true motivation for the exercise of all the gifts.\nPaul said: \u201cPursue love, and desire spiritual gifts\u201d (1 Cor. 14:1). He\nwarned the church that the exercise of the gifts without love has no value\n(1 Cor. 13:1-3). If individuals exercise gifts but are unteachable or have no\n\nconcern to edify the whole body, then they contribute nothing of value to the\nbody of Christ (1 Cor. 13:2). Love is the basic qualification for the ministry\nof gifts; it also ought to be the underlying motive for the desire of the gifts.\nThe gifts and the fruit of the Spirit should be the quest of every Spirit-filled\nbeliever. The Holy Spirit bestows gifts upon believers to be expressed in love\nfor the glory of God.\nVII. Conclusion\nThis section of this book has examined the many ways the Holy Spirit\nworks in and through believers. The Holy Spirit is the Helper of individ-\nual Christ-followers as well as the gathered church. Consequently, there is\ngreat benefit in yielding to and receiving the fullness of the Holy Spirit. The\nHoly Spirit provides fruit and gifts for the edification of the church and the\nadvancement of God\u2019s purposes. Through the baptism with the Holy Spirit,\nbelievers are empowered for spiritual service, holy living and deeper intimacy\nwith God.
