var FOPT_CH4 = {"title": "The Doctrine of Sin", "content": "141\nChapter Four\nThe Doctrine of Sin\nHamartiology\nINTRODUCTION\nHamartiology comes from the Greek words hamartia meaning \u201csin\u201d\nand logos meaning \u201cidea, word, speech, discussion, reason, study.\u201d Thus,\nHamartiology is the study or doctrine of sin. Sin is an obvious reality in the\nworld. The wars and tumults of history exhibit the dire effects of sin. The per-\npetually conflicted human conscience testifies to sin\u2019s existence (Rom. 2:15).\nSin is addressed repeatedly in Scripture. Romans states, \u201c\u2026for all have sinned\nand fall short of the glory of God\u2026\u201d (Rom. 3:23). First John adds, \u201cIf we say\nthat we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us\u201d (1 John\n1:8). To understand the human condition and the righteous plan of God, it\nis necessary to study the doctrine of sin.\nI. The Problem of Sin\nThe presence and origin of sin is a perplexing issue. The fact that all\nhumans are sinners cannot be denied. It is not necessary for humans to learn\nhow to sin. Rather, the principle of sin is in the nature of humans from their\n\nearliest days of life. No child needs to be taught how to do wrong, but every\nchild must be constantly instructed to do what is right.\nA. The source of sin\nThe Bible did not create the problem of sin. Sin was in the world long\nbefore the Bible was written. If the Bible had never been written, or even if\nthe Bible were not true, we would still have the problem of sin.\nAlthough God is the creator of all things, He is not the author of sin.\nScripture clearly states, \u201c\u2026Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from\nthe Almighty to commit iniquity\u201d (Job 34:10). God does not sin, for He is\nholy. The seraphim in Isaiah cried out \u201c\u2026Holy, holy, holy is the LORD\u2026\u201d\n(Isa. 6:3). There is no unrighteousness in God. \u201cHe is the Rock, His work is\nperfect; For all His ways are justice, A God of truth and without injustice;\nRighteous and upright is He\u201d (Deut. 32:4). God cannot be tempted with\nevil, nor does He tempt anyone. \u201cLet no one say when he is tempted, \u2018I am\ntempted by God\u2019; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself\ntempt anyone\u201d (Jas 1:13). God hates sin. As Zechariah states, \u201c\u2018Let none of\nyou think evil in your heart against your neighbor; And do not love a false\noath. For all these are things that I hate,\u2019 Says the Lord\u201d (Zech. 8:17). In\nlight of these and other scriptures, it would be blasphemous to make God the\nauthor of sin.\nFor sin to be sin, in the sense that there is guilt attached to it, it must be\nthe free act of a responsible being who understands the difference between\nright and wrong. Such a being is called a free moral agent.\nB. The permitting of sin\nOne of the great unanswered questions of all time is why God, in\nHis infinite wisdom and power, allowed sin to come into the universe.\nPhilosophers, theologians and scientists have struggled with this question\nthat is beyond the ability of humans to fully answer or even understand.\nRegardless, God was not surprised by the manifestation of sin in the world.\n\nHis holy purposes were not thwarted, nor did God seek to salvage something\nout of unforeseen wreckage. This is not to say that God planned for sin, with\nall its evil and suffering, to come into the world. Rather, for good purposes\nknown only to Him, in spite of the suffering it would cause and the awful\nprice He would pay in the death of His Son, God permitted sin to come first\nto heaven and then to earth.\nLewis Sperry Chafer listed seven reasons for the divine permission of sin14:\n1. The divine recognition of the creature\u2019s free choice: It is evidently\nGod\u2019s purpose to secure a company of beings, for His own glory, who possess\nvirtue resulting from a free choice victory over evil. However, humans are\nunable to make a choice between good and evil unless evil exists.\n2. The specific value of redeemed beings: According to Scripture, God\ndid not seek to avoid the issues that arise because of the presence of sin in\nthe universe. God could have created innocent beings with no capacity to\nerr. However, He desired redeemed souls purified by sacrificial blood and\npurchased at an infinite cost. The expression of such love and the exercise of\nsuch sacrifice are possible only when sin is present in the world.\n3. The acquisition of divine knowledge: Individuals made by God must,\nthrough a process of learning, attain the knowledge God has possessed eter-\nnally. Humans learn through experience and revelation. They must learn con-\ncerning both good and evil. They must realize the sinfulness of sin if they are\nto comprehend, to any degree, God\u2019s knowledge. However, humans cannot\nattain such knowledge unless sin exists as a living reality, ever demonstrating\nits sinful character.\n4. The instruction of angels: Scripture suggests angels are learning\nimportant facts through observing the experiences of humans. The apostle\nPaul wrote that \u201cthe manifold wisdom of God\u201d has been \u201c\u2026made known\nby the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places\u2026(Eph.\n3:10). First Peter states, \u201cTo them [the prophets] it was revealed that, not\n14 Lewis Sperry Chafer, Systematic Theology (Dallas, TX: Dallas Seminary Press, 1947-48) II, 231-233.\n\nto themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have\nbeen reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by\nthe Holy Spirit sent from heaven\u2014things which angels desire to look into\u201d\n(1 Pet. 1:12). If it is necessary for angels to learn the truth of evil and good,\nthey must acquire that knowledge through observing human experience in a\nuniverse where evil is permitted.\n5. The demonstration of God\u2019s hatred of evil: It is evidently of immeasur-\nable importance that God demonstrate His hatred of evil. The apostle Paul\ndeclared that God was \u201c\u2026wanting to show His wrath and to make His power\nknown ...\u201d (Rom. 9:22). God\u2019s judgment, wrath or power, in relation to sin,\ncould not be disclosed apart from the permitted presence of sin in the world.\n6. The righteous judgment of evil: For evil to be judged by God, it must\nevidently be brought out into an open demonstration of its actual character.\nSuch a demonstration cannot be secured with sin existing as a hypothetical\nissue. Consequently, sin had to become concrete and prove its actual character.\n7. The manifestation and exercise of God\u2019s grace: Sin was permitted in\nthe world to demonstrate God\u2019s grace. Before the creation of humans and the\npermission of sin\u2019s existence in the world, the angelic hosts had seen God\u2019s\nwisdom, power and glory; but they had never seen His grace. They had no\nconception of God demonstrating His goodness to the undeserving. Yet\nthrough one marvelous act of mercy, in the gift of His Son as a sacrifice for\nsinners, God extended grace to those who deserved wrath. God demonstrated\nHis grace towards the sinful and undeserving by allowing sinful and unde-\nserving beings to exist in the world.\n\nII. The Origin of Sin\nSin did not begin on earth. The first sin was committed in heaven.\nTherefore, to fully understand sin\u2019s reality and nature, we must first study its\nbeginning in the universe and then its beginning on earth.\nA. The origin of sin in the universe\nFirst, let us consider the person who was responsible for the first sin in\nthe universe:\nMoreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,\n\u201cSon of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre,\nand say to him, \u2018Thus says the Lord GOD: \u201cYou were\nthe seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in\nbeauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every\nprecious stone was your covering: The sardius, topaz,\nand diamond, Beryl, onyx, and jasper, Sapphire, tur-\nquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of\nyour timbrels and pipes Was prepared for you on the\nday you were created. \u201cYou were the anointed cherub\nwho covers; I established you; You were on the holy\nmountain of God; You walked back and forth in the\nmidst of fiery stones. You were perfect in your ways\nfrom the day you were created, Till iniquity was found\nin you. \u201cBy the abundance of your trading You became\nfilled with violence within, And you sinned; Therefore\nI cast you as a profane thing Out of the mountain\nof God; And I destroyed you, O covering cherub,\nFrom the midst of the fiery stones. \u201cYour heart was\nlifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your\nwisdom for the sake of your splendor; I cast you to the\nground, I laid you before kings, That they might gaze at\nyou (Ezek. 28:11-17).\n\nIt is clear that the prophet was describing a supernatural being in this\npassage. The words might apply to a king of Tyre, but they seem to go beyond\nthis application by describing the highest of all created beings. It seems clear\nthat these words apply to Satan before his fall. Isaiah described Satan\u2019s orig-\ninal sin:\nHow you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the\nmorning! How you are cut down to the ground, You\nwho weakened the nations! For you have said in your\nheart: \u201cI will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne\nabove the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of\nthe congregation On the farthest sides of the north; I\nwill ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like\nthe Most High\u201d (Isa. 14:12-14).\nFive times Lucifer lifted up his will against the will of God. Thus, Satan\u2019s\nsin was rebellion against God and the pursuit of total independence from God.\n1. \u201cI will ascend into heaven\u201d: There are three heavens. There is the\natmospheric heaven, the stellar or astronomic heaven and the third or highest\nheaven where God and the saints abide. Paul wrote about having been caught\nup into the \u201cthird heaven\u201d (2 Cor. 12:1-4).\n2. \u201cI will exalt my throne above the stars of God\u201d: This expressed a desire\nto secure rulership over angelic beings, which were sometimes referred to as\nstars or \u201cmorning stars\u201d (see Job 38:7; Rev. 12:3-4).\n3. \u201cI will also sit upon the mount of the congregation\u201d: These words seem\nto express a desire for an earthly kingdom. In scriptural symbolism a moun-\ntain means a kingdom (see Isa. 2:2; Dan. 2:35).\n4. \u201cI will ascend above the heights of the clouds\u201d: Lucifer wanted to pos-\nsess divine glory, which in Scripture is often symbolized by or associated with\nclouds (see Exod. 13:21; Isa. 19:1; Mark 13:26).\n\n5. \u201cI will be like the Most High\u201d: This is the climax of the other four\ndesires. All of these statements express Satan\u2019s desire to be independent from\nand in opposition to God\u2019s will. Satan\u2019s willful ambition against God brought\nsin into a perfect environment. The fall of Lucifer and the angels who rebelled\nwith him was the result of their deliberate, self-determined revolt against God.\nB. The origin of sin in the human race\nGenesis 3 describes how sin first entered the human race. The story of\nAdam and Eve directly contradicts any theory that argues for the moral or\nspiritual evolution of humankind. Humans did not start on the bottom rung\nof the moral ladder and slowly work their way up through the course of time\nand discovery. Instead, God created Adam and Eve in His image, at the top of\nthe created order. Their rebellion led to their moral collapse and fall.\nThe story of Adam and Eve\u2019s rebellion also contradicts theories that blame\nsin solely on heredity or environment. Some believe humans sin because of\ntheir polluted heredity. They theorize that if Adam and Eve had not sinned\nand polluted human heredity, then humans would not sin today. However,\nScripture demonstrates that Adam and Eve had no polluted ancestry behind\nthem, yet they still sinned. Some believe humans sin because they abide in a\nsinful environment. They assume that if we morally clean up society, humans\nwill no longer be subject or prone to sin. Once again, Adam and Eve\u2019s rebel-\nlion contradicts this assumption. The first parents lived in a perfect environ-\nment, yet they sinned. Ultimately, a better heredity or a better environment\nwill not prevent humans from sinning.\nHumans were created to both receive and reciprocate the love of God.\nReal love is bestowed freely, not from compulsion. God gave Adam and Eve\nthe opportunity to love or reject Him. He gave them the opportunity to\nprove their love by a simple act of obedience. They were asked to refrain\nfrom partaking of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.\nGod was not depriving them of anything. He was simply giving them the\nopportunity to prove their love by an act of obedience. Adam and Eve did not\nneed the fruit of this forbidden tree. It was not necessary for their happiness\nor their wellbeing. This is true of sin as well. Sin has added nothing to the\n\nultimate wellbeing and happiness of humanity. The temporary gain of any sin\nis always offset by the death, destruction and brokenness it produces.\nThere was no poison or evil in the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil. The wrong was not in the tree but in the rebellion of Adam and Eve. In\nthe moral economy God established on earth, sin was a possibility but not a\nnecessity. Adam and Eve turned that possibility into an actuality. Surrounded\nwith everything they needed and duly warned by God regarding the conse-\nquences of disobedience, Adam and Eve were completely responsible for their\nsinful behavior. James wrote concerning sin and temptation, \u201cLet no one say\nwhen he is tempted, \u2018I am tempted by God\u2019; for God cannot be tempted by\nevil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is\ndrawn away by his own desires and enticed\u201d (Jas. 1:13-14).\nGod did not permit Satan to coerce or overpower Adam and Eve. The\nserpent tempted them, but he did not force them to eat of the forbidden\nfruit. The temptation of the serpent did not control or overwhelm the origi-\nnal pair. This is true of all temptation. For temptation to lead to sin requires\nthe cooperation of the individuals tempted. Although Adam and Eve could\nblame Satan for tempting them, they were fully to blame for yielding to the\ntemptation. Their choice to sin was their responsibility. Therefore, they bore\nthe penalty. The difference between Satan\u2019s fall and humankind\u2019s fall is that\nSatan fell without any external tempter. The sin of Satan originated in his\nown being, while the sin of humans originated in response to a tempter and\ntemptation from without. Thiessen concluded, \u201cHad man fallen without\na tempter, he would have originated his own sin, and would have himself\nbecome a Satan.\u201d 1\n1 Thiessen, Henry C. Introductory Lectures in Systematic Theology (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans\nPublishing Company, 1949), 248-249.\n\nIII. The First Human Sin\nA. The necessity of testing or probation\nGod made Adam and Eve perfect, in His own image. He placed them in\na perfect environment, supplying their every need. In this perfect environ-\nment, God gave Adam and Eve free will. It was necessary that their free will\nbe tested in order for them to be confirmed and grow in goodness. Character\nis the sum total of human choices. It can be attained only through choices.\nThus, the first human beings were on probation until they could show how\nthey would use the power of their freedom of choice. Although Adam and\nEve could have chosen to resist temptation, they did the opposite.\nB. The process of temptation\nFirst John 2:16 deals with three areas of human temptation: \u201cFor all that\nis in the world\u2014the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of\nlife\u2014is not of the Father but is of the world.\u201d All sin stems from at least one\nof these three temptations. Eve fell for all three: the lust of the eye, \u201cit was\npleasant to the eyes\u201d; the lust of the flesh, \u201cthe tree was good for food\u201d; and\nthe pride of life, \u201c[it was] a tree desirable to make one wise\u201d (Gen. 3). The\nseed of every human sin was visible in Eve\u2019s first sin.\n1. Satan cast doubt on God\u2019s word and love (Gen. 3:1): \u201cNow the serpent\nwas more cunning than any beast of the field which the LorD God had\nmade. And he said to the woman, \u2018Has God indeed said, \u201cYou shall not eat of\nevery tree in the garden\u201d?\u2019\u201d The tempter may have gone to Eve rather than to\nAdam because God had directly given Adam the command forbidding them\nto eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve received the com-\nmand from her husband. So Satan did not go directly to Adam, but through\nthe serpent, he approached Eve while she was alone. Satan tempted Eve by\nquestioning God\u2019s word, \u201cHas God indeed said?\u201d Calling into question the\nveracity of God\u2019s word is one of Satan\u2019s favorite tactics. He also seemed to\nsuggest that God was keeping something back from Adam and Eve, thereby\ncalling God\u2019s love for them into question.\n\n2. Eve tampered with God\u2019s word (Gen. 3:2-3): \u201cAnd the woman said\nto the serpent, \u2018We may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden; but of the\nfruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, \u201cYou\nmust not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.\u201d\u2019\u201d Eve responded to\nthe serpent by altering God\u2019s word. She both added and omitted words\nfrom God\u2019s original commandment (Gen. 2:16-17). She added that God\nhad said of the fruit, \u201cnor shall you touch it.\u201d By adding these false words,\nEve made God\u2019s demands appear unreasonable. Eve also omitted the most\nsevere word of God\u2019s warning that \u201c\u2026you shall surely die\u201d if you consume\nthe forbidden fruit. By changing the severity of God\u2019s words, Eve made\nthe punishment of death seem more like a possible outcome than a certain\nconsequence of rebellion. Whenever humans alter God\u2019s word, there will be\ntragic consequences.\n3. Satan contradicted God\u2019s word: Having sown the seed of doubt in\nEve\u2019s mind concerning what God had said, Satan challenged the truth of\nGod\u2019s words and the reasons behind His command. \u201cThen the serpent said\nto the woman, \u2018You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you\neat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil\u2019\u201d (Gen. 3:4-5). Satan tried to convince Eve that God was lying to her\nand trying to prevent her from obtaining the more exulted position of being\n\u201clike God.\u201d\n4. Eve succumbed to the temptation: Eventually, Eve began to entertain\nthe concepts Satan had introduced. She thought about the attractiveness of\nthe fruit, its satisfying taste and the intriguing possibility of a whole new\nexperience. Eve had already known good. However, the possibility of ventur-\ning into a greater knowledge of good and a new understanding of evil must\nhave piqued her curiosity. \u201cSo when the woman saw that the tree was good\nfor food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one\nwise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and\nhe ate\u201d (Gen. 3:6). Through the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the\npride of life, Adam and Eve rebelled against God.\n\nC. The results of Adam and Eve\u2019s first sin\n1. As seen in their attitude toward themselves\na) Adam and Eve immediately became conscious of their own sin\nbecause their consciences were awakened. Even before God spoke with\nthem, they knew they were sinners. \u201cThen the eyes of both of them were\nopened, and they knew that they were naked\u2026\u201d (Gen. 3:7a). God later\nasked them, \u201cWho told you that you were naked?\u201d (Gen. 3:11). They did\nnot need another to tell them; they knew it themselves. Adam and Eve\nbecame conscious of two realities in relation to their sin: pollution and\nguilt. Being conscious of their pollution, they tried to cover themselves.\nRealizing their guilt they tried to flee when God approached. The pol-\nlution of sin is a fact. Every human bears the stain of sin upon his or her\nsoul. God does not put it there; rather, it is the inevitable result of sin and\nthe guilt that comes from breaking relationship with God.\nb) Adam and Eve vainly sought to cover their sin: \u201c\u2026and they sewed\nfig leaves together and made themselves coverings\u201d (Gen. 3:7b). Prior\nto their sin, Adam and Eve did not need a covering for their bodies.\nSome have speculated that they were covered with the light or glory of\nGod. Whatever Adam and Eve\u2019s condition before their sin, once they\ndisobeyed God, they were instantly aware that they had lost something.\nHumans have the tendency to try to cover up the results of their sin.\nMany attempt to sew for themselves \u201cfig leaves\u201d of self-sufficiency or\nself-righteousness. Adam and Eve quickly discovered that their attempted\ncoverings did not satisfy themselves or their holy God.\n2. As seen in their attitude toward God\na) Adam and Eve fled from the presence of God: \u201cAnd they heard the\nsound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day,\nand Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD\nGod among the trees of the garden\u201d (Gen. 3:8). Sin made a tremendous\ndifference in a very short time. Adam and Eve enjoyed God\u2019s presence\n\nprior to their sin, but after they sinned, they fled from Him. In rebellion,\nsinners will try to hide or flee from the presence of God.\nb) Adam and Eve falsely thought they could hide from God. In try-\ning to hide themselves from God, they did not fully understand their\nall-powerful God who sees and knows all the secrets of the human heart\n(Ps. 139:7-13). However, God\u2019s abundant grace was immediately dis-\nplayed when He sought the fallen pair: \u201cThen the LORD God called\nto Adam and said to him, \u2018Where are you?\u2019\u201d (Gen. 3:9). Ever since He\npursued Adam and Eve, God has taken the initiative in seeking the lost.\nWe see the culmination of this pursuit in the work of Jesus, \u201cFor the Son\nof Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost\u201d (Luke 19:10).\n3. As seen in their attitude toward other people: One of the saddest results\nof sin is its effect upon others. Eve was not content to disobey God alone.\nInstead, she also involved her husband. Humans often try to bring others into\ntheir immoral behavior and often try to blame others for their sinful choices.\nWhen God confronted the first sinners and asked them about their behavior,\nAdam immediately tried to shift the blame to Eve: \u201cThe woman whom You\ngave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate\u201d (Gen. 3:12). Instead\nof taking responsibility for his sin, Adam not only blamed his wife but also\nblamed God for giving him his wife. Sin creates a climate where individu-\nals blame others and refuse to take responsibility for their own actions. In\ncontrast, true repentance begins with the prayer, \u201cGod, be merciful to me a\nsinner\u201d (Luke 18:13).\nD. The curse caused by the first sin\nIt was one sin, one act of rebellious disobedience that broke humankind\u2019s\nfellowship with God. In response to this original sin, God pronounced curses\nunder which all creation has suffered.\n1. The curse upon the serpent: \u201cSo the LORD God said to the serpent:\n\u2018Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more\nthan every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat\n\ndust All the days of your life\u2019\u201d (Gen. 3:14). This verse indicates that the curse\nis upon the entire animal kingdom.\n2. The curse upon the woman: \u201cTo the woman He said: \u2018I will greatly\nmultiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth\nchildren; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you\u2019\u201d\n(Gen. 3:16).\n3. The curse upon the man: \u201cCursed is the ground for your sake; In toil\nyou shall eat of it All the days of your life\u2026In the sweat of your face you shall\neat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For\ndust you are, And to dust you shall return (Gen. 3:17-19). This curse plainly\nincludes both physical and spiritual death. With this curse, Adam and Eve\nwere expelled from the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:22-24). Though this seems\nto be a severe judgment, God did not want fallen humans to eat of the tree of\nlife and live forever in their sin, thus making redemption impossible.\n4. The curse upon the ground: \u201cCursed is the ground for your sake ...\nBoth thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you\u201d (Gen. 3:17-18). This\nverse indicates that the soil and all that grows in the soil are under a curse.\nIV. The Nature of Sin\nA. Sin defined\nPerhaps the best definition for sin is found in the Larger Catechism\n(Westminster): \u201cSin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of, any\nlaw of God given as a rule to the reasonable creature.\u201d 2 Chafer and other\ntheologians believe it would be better to substitute \u201ccharacter\u201d for \u201claw\u201d in\nthis definition, as the law of God may not include all that God\u2019s character\nrequires.3 Anything that contradicts God\u2019s holiness is sin. Therefore, the defi-\nnition might be more comprehensive if both thoughts were included: \u201cSin is\n2 Assembly of Divines, Larger Catechism (Westminster, England. 1723).\n3 Chafer, 227.\n\nany want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the character or law of God\ngiven as a rule to the reasonable creature.\u201d Sin directed against God\u2019s person-\nhood is godlessness, defilement or selfhood. Sin directed against God\u2019s laws\nor moral government is transgression, rebellion or lawlessness. The former\nwas illustrated when the prophet Isaiah encountered God\u2019s presence: \u201cWoe is\nme, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the\nmidst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, The LORD\nof hosts\u201d (Isa. 6:5). The latter was illustrated by Paul who made it clear that\ntransgression of the law is also sin: \u201cFor as many as are of the works of the\nlaw are under the curse; for it is written, \u2018Cursed is everyone who does not\ncontinue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them\u2019\u201d\n(Gal. 3:10).\nB. Sin and God\u2019s law\n1. The nature of God\u2019s law: Since sin is any want of conformity unto or\ntransgression of God\u2019s law, it is important to understand a few things about\nGod\u2019s law.\na) There is nothing wrong with the law itself. Some have so empha-\nsized the fact that we are under grace and not under law that it would be\neasy for some to think the law was evil. However, Paul made it clear that\nthe law is holy and good (Rom. 7:12). It is a revelation of God\u2019s nature\nand will; therefore, the law can only be good.\nb) God\u2019s law is not arbitrary because it springs from His own nature.\nGod\u2019s laws are not right because He says they are right. Rather, God\u2019s\nlaws are right because He is right in all He says and does. If God\u2019s laws\nwere not right and just, He would be a despot.\nc) When God gave humans His law, He was fully aware they would\nnot\u2014indeed, could not\u2014keep His law. Why then did an all-wise God\ngive a set of laws to a people He knew could not keep them? As in all His\nways, God had a wise and good purpose in giving humans the law.\n\n2. The purpose of God\u2019s law\na) The law was given to intensify people\u2019s knowledge of sin. A per-\nson\u2019s conscience will bear inner witness to the fact that he or she is a\nsinner, but God\u2019s published law provides a clearer understanding of what\nsin is: \u201c\u2026for by the law is the knowledge of sin\u201d (Rom. 3:20; see also\nRom. 7:7).\nb) The law was given to reveal the holiness of God. The detailed cer-\nemonial laws, offerings and priestly requirements clearly communicate\nthat God is holy, set apart and perfect in all His ways. Roman\u2019s states,\n\u201cTherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and\ngood\u201d (Rom. 7:12).\nc) The law was given to lead people to Christ. The law is called a\ntutor: \u201cTherefore the law was our tutor [paidagogos] to bring us to Christ,\nthat we might be justified by faith\u201d (Gal. 3:24). A paidagogos was usually a\ntrusted servant responsible for overseeing the general care of their master\u2019s\nsons from about age six to sixteen. As part of the son\u2019s care, the paidagogos\nwould take him to and from his teachers\u2019 houses or schools of physical\ntraining. By comparing the law to a paidagogos, Paul implied that the law\nhad a temporary and provisional nature until the child became of age and\ncould participate fully in his father\u2019s inheritance.\nAlthough the law could not save, it did serve to help humans realize\ntheir need of Christ. The law, through its offerings, priesthood and taber-\nnacle pointed to the cross of Christ as the only way of salvation and access\nto God. The law was no longer needed once Christ became humankind\u2019s\nSavior. The Bible teaches that through the death of Christ, believers are\ndelivered not only from the curse or penalty of the law but also from\nthe law itself: \u201cChrist has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having\nbecome a curse for us (for it is written, \u2018Cursed is everyone who hangs on\na tree\u2019)\u201d (Gal. 3:13). Therefore, believers \u201care not under law but under\ngrace\u201d (Rom. 6:14). In Christ, life is \u201cnot under the law\u201d but \u201cled by the\nSpirit\u201d (Gal 5:18).\n\nC. Scriptural expressions for sin\nThe following are some ways the Bible describes sin:\n1. Missing the mark or aim (Rom. 3:23; 5:12); most frequently used term\nin both the Old and New Testament\n2. Transgressing or trespassing (Gal. 6:1; 1 Tim. 2:14)\n3. Disobeying God\u2019s voice (Heb. 2:2-3)\n4. Committing sin in ignorance of what ought to be known (Heb. 9:7)\n5. Diminishing that which should have been rendered in full (1 Cor. 6:7;\ni.e., Annanias and Saphira, Acts 5:2)\n6. Sinning through omission or through not doing what ought to be done\n(Jas. 4:17)\n7. Committing lawlessness or anarchy (1 John 3:4)\n8. Owing a debt or failing to fulfill a God-given duty or obligation\n(Matt. 6:12)\n9. Other words associated with sin: iniquity (Lev. 26:40); ungodly\n(Prov. 11:31); unbelief (Rom. 11:20); unrighteousness (1 John 1:9);\nunholy (1 Tim. 1:9)\nD. Sin and evil\n1. Sin is a specific type of evil. Physical evils and moral evils exist in the\nworld. Physical evils such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes are not sins.\nThey are not moral evils but have been used by God to punish or chastise\nthose who have broken His law. It is in this sense that God is said to \u201ccre-\nate calamity\u201d (Isa. 45:7). Calamity or ra in Hebrew is never rendered \u201csin.\u201d\nInstead, it is usually translated as \u201cevil, calamity or adversity.\u201d God made the\nlaw and its penalties for breaking it. If people sin, they will reap the results.\n2. Sin is an active evil. Sin is more than just failing to keep the law.\nInstead, sin is the purposeful, active choice to do evil.\n\nE. The nature of sin\nSin does not merely consist of outward acts. While it is true that people\nare sinners because they sin, it is a fundamental principle that as a result\nof Adam and Eve\u2019s rebellion, people sin because they are sinners. In other\nwords, the descendants of Adam and Eve are sinners by nature before they\nbecome sinners by practice. Adam and Eve\u2019s rebellion corrupted their natures.\nConsequently, all the descendants of Adam and Eve are born with sinful\nnatures; because of this nature they sin.\nJesus said that a tree brings forth fruit according to its nature (Matt. 7:17-\n18). To announce the coming of Jesus, John the Baptist said, \u201c\u2026the ax is laid\nto the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit\nis cut down and thrown into the fire\u201d (Matt. 3:10). The problem of the fruit\nwas due to the basic condition of the tree, just as the problem of sin is rooted\nin the sinful nature of humanity.\nThe outward expression of sin is motivated by the inward condition of\nthe human heart. Consequently, Jesus condemned both the adulterous look\nas well as the act of adultery (Matt. 5:27-28). He condemned and equated\nanger with murder since anger can lead to the outward expression of violence\nand killing (Matt. 5:21-22). The sinful nature and wicked motivations of\nhumans lead to sinful and wicked expressions. Sin is not being confronted\nwith the possibility to lust or murder; rather, temptation leads to sin when a\nperson \u201c\u2026is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire\nhas conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth\ndeath\u201d (Jas. 1:14-15).\nThe New Testament differentiates between the sin nature and the results\nor expressions of that nature. Paul understood that the sin nature was present\nbefore the law. In Romans he wrote, \u201cI would not have known sin except\nthrough the law\u2026But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, pro-\nduced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead\u2026\nbut when the commandment came, sin revived and I died\u201d (Rom. 7:7-9).\nUltimately, when humans commit sinful acts, they are expressing their sinful\n\ncondition. Jesus stated, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is\na slave of sin\u2026\u201d (John 8:34).\nHumans express sinful behavior because \u201cthey are all under sin\u201d (Rom.\n3:9). Paul wrote \u201c\u2026through one man [Adam] sin entered the world, and\ndeath through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned\u2026\u201d\n(Rom. 5:12). The Scripture states that sin\u2019s pollution permeates the human\ncondition: \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked\u2026\u201d\n(Jer. 17:9). Jesus proclaimed, \u201c\u2026an evil man out of the evil treasure of his\nheart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth\nspeaks\u201d (Luke 6:45). In light of their wicked condition, humans require a sal-\nvation that transforms human nature. To receive this new nature, each human\n\u201cmust be born again\u201d (John 3:7). Thiessen quoted Charles Hodge as saying:\n\u201cSin includes guilt and pollution; the one expresses its relation to the justice,\nthe other to the holiness of God.\u201d4 The good news of the gospel is that this\nguilt and pollution are removed because \u201c\u2026the blood of Jesus Christ His Son\ncleanses us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:7).\nF. Important considerations regarding sin\n1. Sins of omission: Not doing what God\u2019s law requires (omission) is as\nsinful as breaking the law (commission). James states, \u201cTherefore, to him\nwho knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin\u201d (Jas. 4:17).\n2. Sins of unbelief: Failing to believe God\u2019s word or failing to believe\nin the Son of God is sin. Jesus told his disciples that the Holy Spirit would\ncome, \u201cAnd when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of\nrighteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe in Me\u2026\u201d\n(John 16:8-9).\n3. Sins of ignorance: The Scripture makes it clear that ignorance of the\nlaw is not an appropriate excuse for breaking the law. Leviticus states, \u201cIf a\nperson sins, and commits any of these things which are forbidden to be done\nby the commandments of the LORD, though he does not know it, yet he is\n4 Charles Hodge, as quoted by Thiessen, 245.\n\nguilty and shall bear his iniquity\u201d (Lev. 5:17). This concept is also expressed\nin the New Testament: \u201cAnd that servant who knew his master\u2019s will, and did\nnot prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many\nstripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes,\nshall be beaten with few\u2026\u201d (Luke 12:47-48).\n4. The sin of breaking one law is the sin of breaking all laws: James states,\n\u201cFor whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is\nguilty of all\u201d (Jas. 2:10). Consequently, it only takes one sin to make a person\na sinner.\nV. The Universality of Sin\nScripture bears testimony to the sinfulness of all humankind. First Kings\n8:46 states, \u201c\u2026for there is no one who does not sin\u2026\u201d Ecclesiastes pro-\nclaims, \u201cFor there is not a just man on earth who does good And does not\nsin\u201d (Eccles. 7:20). In the New Testament we read, \u201cFor all have sinned and\nfall short of the glory of God\u201d (Rom. 3:23). Scripture teaches that through\nthe sin of Adam and Eve, all people are counted as sinners. However, Christ\ndied for all and provided the means by which all can be saved: \u201cFor as by one\nman\u2019s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s obedience\nmany will be made righteous\u201d (Rom. 5:19).\nVI. The Imputation of Sin\nImputation means attributing or reckoning something to a person. A\ngood illustration of this principle is when Paul stated that he would pay\nthe debt or make amends for any wrongdoing associated with Onesimus\n(Philem. 1:17-18). The Bible describes three separate instances of impu-\ntation: (1) Adam\u2019s sin imputed to the human race, (2) humanity\u2019s sin\nimputed to Christ as He died for all humanity and (3) Christ\u2019s righteous-\nness imputed to believers through faith in Christ. These examples of impu-\ntation are addressed in Romans 5:12-21, one of the greatest passages in\n\nthe Bible. Romans 5:12 is the key verse in this passage: \u201cTherefore, just as\nthrough one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus\ndeath spread to all men, because all sinned.\u201d Sin did not begin with Adam;\nit merely entered into the human race through him. Sin had its beginning\nwith Lucifer (Ezek. 28:12-17).\nThe important expression is \u201cbecause all sinned.\u201d The Greek aorist\ntense is used, indicating a single, historical act that was completed in the\npast. Adam was the natural head of the human race. All humankind was in\nAdam when he sinned. Consequently, we are all sinners because we sinned\nin Adam. This principle is illustrated by the author of Hebrews who wrote,\n\u201cEven Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,\nfor he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him\u201d (Heb.\n7:9-10). In other words, Abraham\u2019s actions were attributed to Levi, even\nthough Levi was not yet born when Abraham honored Melchizedek. In like\nmanner, the whole human race was in Adam, their natural head, when he\nsinned. Therefore, God imputed the sin of Adam to each member of the\nhuman race.\nRomans 5:12 is not a reference to personal sin. Paul made that concept\nclear in Romans 5:14, \u201cNevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,\neven over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the trans-\ngression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\u201d In this passage,\nPaul pointed out that death reigned before the law was given to Moses.\nIf humans were not responsible for breaking laws that had not yet been\ngiven by Moses and if they suffered the penalty of sin, which is death, then\nthe sin that caused them to die could not have been personal sin. Instead,\nthey must have been considered sinners and faced death because of the sin\nof Adam.\nAdam was the figure or type of Christ Jesus \u201cwho was to come.\u201d Paul\nmade several comparisons and contrasts between the first Adam and the Last\nAdam, Christ: \u201cTherefore, as through one man\u2019s offense judgment came to\nall men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man\u2019s righteous\nact the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. For as\nby one man\u2019s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s\n\nobedience many will be made righteous\u201d (Rom. 5:18-19). Some argue it is\nunjust that Adam\u2019s sin is imputed to all humanity. However, by this same\nlogic, it would also be unjust to impute the righteousness of Jesus Christ to\nthose who believe in the saving work of Jesus. The fall of humanity through\nAdam and the restoration of humanity through Christ are the basis for jus-\ntification and salvation by faith.\nIt might seem that certain Old Testament scriptures contradict each\nother concerning how God deals with sin. Exodus states that God will visit\n\u201c\u2026the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth gen-\nerations\u2026\u201d (Exod. 20:5). However, Ezekiel states, \u201cThe son shall not bear\nthe guilt of the father\u2026The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon\nhimself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself\u201d (Ezek.\n18:20). Further study of these texts demonstrates very different contexts.\nSome passages seem to deal with the natural consequences of the parents\u2019\nsin, while the Ezekiel passage seems to refer to the guilt and penalty of the\nparents\u2019 sin. Children often bear the consequences of their parents\u2019 wrong\nchoices and wrongdoing. However, nowhere in the Bible does it teach that\nchildren are guilty of or should be punished for the individual sin or sins\nof their parents.\nVII. Original Sin and Depravity\nA. The meaning of depravity\nOriginal sin refers to the first sin of Adam as well as the sinful nature\npossessed by every person since Adam due to Adam\u2019s initial transgression.\nThis sinful nature is called \u201cdepravity.\u201d The following are characteristics of\ndepraved individuals:\n1. They are void of original righteousness: \u201cBehold, I was brought forth\nin iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me\u201d (Ps. 51:5).\n\n2. They do not possess holy affection toward God: \u201cFor men will be lov-\ners of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient\nto parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without\nself-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of\npleasure rather than lovers of God\u201d (2 Tim. 3:2-4).\n3. Their defilement comes from within, not from without: \u201cThere is\nnothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things\nwhich come out of him, those are the things that defile a man\u201d (Mark 7:15).\n4. They have a continual bias toward evil: \u201cThen the LORD saw that\nthe wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the\nthoughts of his heart was only evil continually\u201d (Gen. 6:5).\nB. The result of man\u2019s depravity\nIt is exceedingly easy to see the result of sinful depravity in the human\nrace. Every aspect of human existence has been marred and harmed by\nthe sinful rebellion of humanity. Romans best summarizes the results of\nman\u2019s depravity:\nAnd even as they did not like to retain God in their\nknowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to\ndo those things which are not fitting; being filled with\nall unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness,\ncovetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife,\ndeceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters,\nhaters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil\nthings, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrust-\nworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, know-\ning the righteous judgment of God, that those who\npractice such things are deserving of death, not only do\nthe same but also approve of those who practice them\n(Rom. 1:28-32).\n\nVIII. The Guilt from Sin\nA. Sin in relation to God\nGuilt is one of God\u2019s just punishments for an individual\u2019s self-determined\nviolation of the law or failure to conform to the law. Guilt is the result of sin\nin relation to God\u2019s wrath. There are natural results of sin in the sinner\u2019s life,\nbut wrath brings God into the picture. Every sin is an offense against God\nand is therefore subject to His wrath (see Ps. 7:11; John 3:18, 36). David\u2019s\nrepentance reached its height when he realized he had sinned not only against\nBathsheba and her husband, Uriah, but also against God. \u201cAgainst You, You\nonly, have I sinned, And done this evil in Your sight\u2014That You may be\nfound just when You speak, And blameless when You judge\u201d (Ps. 51:4). All\nsin is ultimately against God. Romans 3:19 states the case well: \u201cNow we\nknow that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that\nevery mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before\nGod.\u201d Sin is an affront to God\u2019s holiness. God\u2019s response to sin is wrath: \u201cFor\nthe wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrigh-\nteousness of men\u2026\u201d (Rom. 1:18). One aspect of God\u2019s wrath is the subjec-\ntion of unrepentant sinners to the devastating consequences that accompany\ntheir own sinful rebellion (Rom. 1:24, 26, 28). Consequently, wrath can be\nboth the hand of God extended and the hand of God removed.\nB. Degrees of guilt\nScripture makes it clear that there are degrees of guilt and degrees of pun-\nishment. This principle is recognized by the variety of sacrifices required for\ndifferent kinds of sins (Lev. 4-7). The New Testament also suggests degrees\nof guilt (Luke 12:47-48; John 19:11; Rom. 2:6; Heb. 2:2-3; 10:28-29). The\nfollowing are some ways sin and guilt are differentiated:\n1. Sins of nature versus sins of personal transgression: Humans are sin-\nners because of the principle of inborn sin or sins of nature. However, there is\ngreater guilt when people commit acts of personal transgression.\n\n2. Sins committed in ignorance versus sins committed with knowledge:\nAlthough there are sins of ignorance, sins committed with knowledge are\naccompanied by greater guilt; the greater the knowledge, the greater the guilt.\nJesus demonstrated this truth in His rebuke of Chorazin and Bethsaida, \u201c\u2026if\nthe mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon,\nthey would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will\nbe more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you\u201d (Luke\n10:13-14). Paul wrote, \u201cFor as many as have sinned without law will also\nperish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by\nthe law\u201d (Rom. 2:12).\n3. Sins of weakness versus sins of presumption: The psalmist prayed,\n\u201cKeep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have\ndominion over me\u201d (Ps. 19:13). In contrast, Peter demonstrated a sin of\nweakness. He promised he would die with Jesus even if everyone else stum-\nbled and turned away (Matt. 26:33-35). Later, Peter found he did not have\nthe strength to live up to his promises (Matt. 26:69-75). The Bible also seems\nto contrast the difference between sins of impulse and sins of deliberation.\nDavid\u2019s sin against Bathsheba was one of impulse; his sin against Uriah was\none of deliberation because he carefully planned Uriah\u2019s death.\nIX. The Penalty of Sin\nA. The significance of penalty\nPenalty is the pain or loss that is directly inflicted by the Lawgiver in\nvindication of His justice, which has been outraged by the violation of law.\nThere are natural consequences of sin. Paul wrote, \u201cFor the wages of sin is\ndeath\u2026\u201d (Rom. 6:23). Hebrews adds, \u201c\u2026it is appointed for men to die\nonce, but after this the judgment\u201d (Heb. 9:27). Physical death is one of the\nnatural results of sin, but there is an \u201cafter this\u201d that represents the penalty\nto follow. Ungodliness results in physical, mental, and spiritual deterio-\nration. But this is only part of the penalty. In all penalty there is the holy\nwrath of the Lawgiver. The one may be suffered now, but the other is to\nbe experienced in the future. \u201cDepravity and guilt, as consequences of sin,\n\nrest upon mankind now, but penalty in its fullness awaits a future day.\u201d5\nAlthough all have sinned, and all deserve punishment, Christ took that\npunishment upon Himself through the work of the cross. By taking every\nsinner\u2019s punishment upon Himself, Jesus freed all who have faith in Him\nfrom final punishment. Even so, until death, every person will still experi-\nence the results of living in a sin-cursed world.\nIt is important to note the difference between chastisement (discipline)\nand punishment. Punishment proceeds from justice, while chastisement is\ncorrective and not punitive. Ultimately, God\u2019s discipline is an expression of\nGod\u2019s transformational love. Hebrews states, \u201cFor whom the LORD loves He\nchastens, and scourges every son whom He receives\u201d (Heb. 12:6).\nB. The nature of penalty\nThe one word in Scripture that designates the total penalty of sin is\n\u201cdeath.\u201d Death can be physical, spiritual and eternal.\n1. Physical death: Humans were created with a capacity for immortality;\nAdam and Eve would not have died if they had obeyed God\u2019s law. God made\nsure Adam knew he would die when he ate of the forbidden tree (Gen. 2:17).\nOnce Adam and Eve sinned, they did not immediately die, but from that\ntime on, death was working in their physical frames. After hundreds of years,\nAdam and Eve both eventually died. Death is not the cessation of the person-\nality, but the separation of the soul from the body, \u201cincluding all those tempo-\nral evils and sufferings which result from disturbance of the original harmony\nbetween body and soul, and which are the working of death in us.\u201d6 Only\nthrough an act of redemption could humans again have access to the tree of\nlife. At the time of their resurrection, eternal, physical life will be restored to\nthose who have received Christ Jesus as their Savior. In the resurrection, their\nsouls and spirits will be reunited with their bodies. For Christians, the penalty\nof death has been satisfied and removed since Christ bore that penalty for\nthem. Consequently, physical death for believers becomes a gateway through\n5 Thiessen, 270.\n6 Strong, 656.\n\nwhich the soul enters into the fullest enjoyment of all the benefits secured in\nChrist (Eph. 2:7).\n2. Spiritual death: Ultimately, spiritual death is the separation of the soul\nfrom God, \u201cincluding all that pain of conscience, loss of peace, and sorrow of\nspirit, which result from disturbance of the normal relation between the soul\nand God.\u201d7 While Adam did not die physically the moment he disobeyed\nGod, he did die spiritually. He lost that communion with God, which is\nthe source of all life. He became \u201cdead in trespasses and sins\u201d (Eph. 2:1).\nWhen Jesus said, \u201cAnd whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die\u201d\n(John 11:26), He was speaking of the restoration of spiritual life through His\nredeeming grace.\n3. Eternal death: Eternal death is the culmination and completion of\nspiritual death, and speaks of eternal separation of the soul from God. This is\nalso called \u201cthe second death\u201d (Rev. 21:8). John states, \u201c\u2026the hour is coming\nin which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth\u2014those\nwho have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done\nevil, to the resurrection of condemnation\u201d (John 5:28-29). Chafer discussed\nthe second death:\nIt is true that the \u201csecond death,\u201d which is eternal, is\na separation from God and that eternal estate is an\nimmeasurable penalty in the light of the fact that the\nlost soul must know what grace might have wrought.\nThe penalty is a definite imposition over and above the\nnatural course of events\u2014a retribution which corre-\nsponds to the punishment required. It is as certain as\nthe character of God that whatever is imposed will be\njust and right, and it will be so recognized by all. God\nwill not in this, any more than in any other undertak-\ning, be the author of that which is evil.8\n7 Strong, 659.\n8 Thiessen, 270.\n\nX. Conclusion\nIn the beginning, Adam and Eve were given all they needed for abundant\nlife and fellowship with God. Instead of loving God and honoring God, they\nchose to disobey His commands. By choosing to follow their own will instead\nof God\u2019s will, Adam and Eve brought sin and rebellion into the world. The\nfruit of this rebellion is death and destruction along with the loss of intimate,\nloving fellowship between God and His creation. The testimony of Scripture\nand the observable reality of existence points to the presence of sin and the\nneed for a Savior. Through examining the reality of sin, humans gain a greater\nunderstanding and appreciation of the rescuing work of Jesus Christ.\n\n"};
