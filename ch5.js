The word\nsoteriology is derived from the Greek soteria, meaning \u201csalvation,\u201d and logos,\nmeaning \u201cidea, word, speech, discussion, reason, study.\u201d The study of theol-\nogy reveals the holiness of God, while anthropology and hamartiology reveal\nthe sin and failure of humanity. Soteriology is the study of how God has\nbridged the gap between His holiness and humankind\u2019s sinfulness. God fore-\nknew the rebellion and fall of humanity. Therefore, He developed a plan of\nsalvation before the foundation of the earth was laid. Before sin and its blight\nentered the universe, God planned a way of escape. Before humans, made in\nGod\u2019s image, rebelled against their created purpose, God provided a way of\nrescue from the snares and condemnation of sin. The rebellion of humanity\ndid not catch God unaware. God foreknew the fall of humanity, and He fore-\nordained the plan of rescue.\nGod\u2019s plan of salvation is so simple that all people can grasp and expe-\nrience its transforming power. While simple, it is profoundly powerful in\nadequately addressing the spiritual condition of every human being. In fact,\n\nGod\u2019s plan of salvation is the one and only answer to the vast array of spiritual\nneeds represented in every race, culture, community and nation.\nThe heart of God\u2019s plan of salvation centers on the office and function of\na mediator who could bridge the gap between an offended God and helpless,\nsinful humanity. Job expressed this longing for a mediator while lamenting\nhis perceived distance from God. \u201cFor He is not a man, as I am, That I\nmay answer Him, And that we should go to court together. Nor is there any\nmediator between us, Who may lay his hand on us both\u201d (Job 9:32-33).\nUltimately, Christ has become the perfect mediator as the substitutionary\nsacrifice for all humankind. Scripture states, \u201cFor there is one God and one\nMediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a\nransom for all\u2026\u201d (1 Tim. 2:5-6).\nThrough the incarnation Jesus became the perfect mediator for sin by\nrepresenting both God and humanity. The penalty for the sins of humanity\nwas death. This penalty had to be dealt with for humans to have fellowship\nwith God. Since God could not die, He became flesh to satisfy the penalty of\ndeath: \u201cthe Word became flesh and dwelt among us\u201d (John 1:14). The author\nof Hebrews provided the following explanation:\nInasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh\nand blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same,\nthat through death He might destroy him who had the\npower of death, that is, the devil, and release those who\nthrough fear of death were all their lifetime subject to\nbondage. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but\nHe does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in\nall things He had to be made like His brethren, that He\nmight be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things\npertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of\nthe people (Heb. 2:14-17).\nSalvation has been made possible through the mediating death, burial\nand resurrection of Jesus Christ. The following study of the doctrine of sal-\nvation is divided into two sections: (1) the provisions of God: including the\n\ndeath, burial, resurrection, ascension and exaltation of Jesus Christ and (2)\nthe application of God\u2019s provisions: including repentance, faith, justification,\nregeneration, adoption, sanctification, assurance and security.\nI. Salvation and the Death of Christ\nThrough His mighty works and miracles, Christ gave ample evidence that\nHe was the Son of God. However, His work on earth was not completed or\nfinished by the mighty deeds He performed, the great truths He preached or\nthe powerful blessings He imparted. This is because His primary purpose in\ncoming to earth was to save people. When the angel of God spoke to Joseph\nabout the child to be born of Mary, he said, \u201cAnd she will bring forth a Son,\nand you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their\nsins\u201d (Matt. 1:21). Saving people from their sins would require Christ\u2019s death.\nA. The importance of the death of Christ\nChristianity is unlike all other religions in the place it assigns to the death\nof its founder. All other religions base their claim to greatness on the life\nand teaching of those who founded them; the gospel centers on the person\nof Jesus Christ and His death at Calvary. It is true that there is some ethical\nvalue in other non-Christian religious or philosophical teachings, but only\nChristianity provides redemption from sin that is accomplished through the\nsubstitutionary death of the Son of God.\n1. Foretold in the Old Testament: The death of Christ is foreseen\nthroughout the Old Testament in many types and prophesies. The following\nare some of the most outstanding occurrences:\na) Types\n(1) The coverings of skins for Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:21): God sacri-\nficed the life of an animal for the purpose of covering the consequences of\n\nAdam and Eve\u2019s sin. Jesus became the perfect sacrifice for all sin, covering\nthe redeemed with robes of righteousness.\n(2) Abel\u2019s offering of the firstfruits of his flock (Gen. 4:4): Abel\noffered God the best portion of the firstborn of his flock. Jesus became\nthe perfect offering, God\u2019s only begotten Son offered for the sins of the\nworld (John 3:16).\n(3) The Passover lamb (Exod. 12): As the blood of an unblemished\nmale lamb rescued Israel\u2019s firstborn males from God\u2019s judgment, the\nblood of Jesus Christ became the way of deliverance for all of humanity.\n(4) The Levitical sacrificial system (Lev. 17): Jesus became the ulti-\nmate sacrifice to fulfill the righteous requirements of God.\n(5) The bronze serpent (Num. 21): \u201cAnd as Moses lifted up the ser-\npent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up\u2026\u201d\n(John 3:14).\n(6) The slain lamb: \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; We have\nturned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the\niniquity of us all. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened\nnot His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep\nbefore its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth\u201d (Isa. 53:6-7).\nb) Prophecies\n(1) The Seed of the woman to bruise the serpent\u2019s head: \u201cAnd I will\nput enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and\nher Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel\u201d (Gen.\n3:15).\n(2) The crucifixion scene (Ps. 22)\n\n(3) The vicarious suffering (Isa. 53)\n(4) The cutoff Messiah (Dan. 9:26)\n(5) The smitten Shepherd (Zech. 13:6-7)\n2. Emphasized in the New Testament: In His conversation with the two\ndisciples on the way to Emmaus following His resurrection, Jesus stated that\nMoses, all the prophets and all Scripture spoke of His death: \u201cAnd beginning\nat Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures\nthe things concerning Himself\u201d (Luke 24:27). Peter made it clear that the\nsuffering of Christ was the one great subject into which the Old Testament\nprophets inquired and searched diligently: \u201cOf this salvation the prophets\nhave inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace that would\ncome to you, searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ\nwho was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings\nof Christ and the glories that would follow\u201d (1 Pet. 1:10-11). The death of\nJesus Christ is a major focus of all four Gospels. Thiessen stated: \u201cThe last\nthree days of our Lord\u2019s earthly life occupy about one-fifth of the narratives\nin the four Gospels.\u201d1\n3. Its relation to the incarnation: Jesus Christ\u2019s incarnation was essential\nfor sin to die and be defeated in the flesh. Christ came into the world for the\nexpress purpose of giving Himself as a ransom for all sin. \u201cHe was manifested\nto take away our sins\u201d (1 John 3:5). To defeat sin in the flesh, Jesus had to\ndie a bodily death. Theissen clearly connected Christ\u2019s incarnation and death:\n\u201cHis death was not an afterthought or an accident, but the accomplishment\nof a divine purpose in connection with the incarnation. The incarnation is\nnot an end in itself; it is but a means to an end, and that end is the redemp-\ntion of the lost through the Lord\u2019s death on the cross.\u201d2 Jesus partook of flesh\nand blood in order that He might die. Hebrews states it best, \u201cInasmuch then\nas the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared\n1 Henry Clarence Thiessen, Introductory Lectures in Systematic Theology (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.\nEerdmans Publishing Company, 1949) 313.\n2 Thiessen, 314.\n\nin the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of\ndeath, that is, the devil\u2026\u201d (Heb. 2:14).\n4. A fundamental truth of the gospel: Paul emphasized that the death,\nburial and resurrection of Christ constituted the gospel. \u201cMoreover, brethren,\nI declare to you the gospel\u2026that Christ died for our sins according to the\nScriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day\naccording to the Scriptures\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 15:1-4). The gospel is the \u201cgood news\u201d\nof salvation, the forgiveness of sins through the death, burial and resurrection\nof Jesus Christ.\n5. A necessity for humankind\u2019s salvation: Christ\u2019s death was absolutely\nnecessary for God to pardon sin and provide salvation. Note how \u201cmust\u201d and\n\u201chad to\u201d occur in the following passages (emphasis added):\na) \u201cAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so\nmust the Son of Man be lifted up\u2026\u201d (John 3:14).\nb) \u201cFrom that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He\nmust go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief\npriests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day\u201d (Matt.\n16:21).\nc) \u201cBut first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this\ngeneration\u201d (Luke 17:25).\nd) \u201cThe Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,\nand be crucified, and the third day rise again\u201d (Luke 24:7).\ne) \u201cThen Paul\u2026for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the\nScriptures, explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer\nand rise again from the dead\u201d (Acts 17:2-3).\nThe only basis on which a holy God could forgive sin was through\nHis Son bearing the penalty for sin. God could not forgive sinners merely\n\non the grounds of their repentance. Rather, forgiveness required that the\npenalty must be fully paid. God does not forgive sinners simply because\nHe is love. Rather, sinners are forgiven because God\u2019s love caused Him to\ngive His only begotten Son as a ransom for sin. It is the loving sacrifice\nof Jesus Christ that atoned for the sin and provided forgiveness. George\nHerbert Morrison expressed the concept beautifully:\n\u201cLet me say that the cross is not needed and included\nbecause of God\u2019s unwillingness to pardon. Nowhere in\nthe New Testament is the cross conceived as turning\nan unwilling God into a willing one, as a compulsion\non a reluctant God. It is not the cause of love, it is its\nconsequence; it is the spring of love, it is its outflow,\nand that is what is so often forgotten. We read in the\nNew Testament of Christ being offered as a propitia-\ntion for our sins, and our thoughts go back to pagan\nfaiths, where men tried to appease their angry gods; but\nthe tremendous difference is that in all these faiths man\nhad to provide the propitiation; in the Christian faith\nGod provides it. He does not ask men for an atoning\nsacrifice; He gives the atoning sacrifice, and He gives\nit because He loves the world and willeth not that any\nman should perish ... It is because He is so passionately\neager to forgive that God sent His Son to die.\u201d3\nB. The true meaning of the death of Christ\nGod performed an amazing work to span the gulf between the depths\nof human sin and the purity of His own holiness. Through His death, Jesus\nChrist fully met every human need relative to sin, enabling every human the\nability to enjoy eternal fellowship with God. At the same time, Christ fully\nmet every requirement necessary for a righteous and just God to freely forgive\nsin and receive humankind back into fellowship. In Christ, God has both\njudged sin and justified sinners (Rom. 3:26). At no time throughout eternity\n3 George Herbert Morrison, The Significance of the Cross (New York: George H. Doran Company, 1924) as\nquoted in Decision Magazine (December 1964).\n\nwill anyone be able to challenge the perfect and full provision of God\u2019s great\nsalvation. To grasp the full extent of what was accomplished through the\ndeath of Jesus Christ, it is necessary to understand the meaning and implica-\ntion of certain foundational terms.\n1. The death of Christ is vicarious: The word vicarious comes from\n\u201cvicar,\u201d meaning \u201ca substitute who takes the place of another and acts in his\nstead.\u201d Since Jesus Christ \u201ccommitted no sin,\u201d it is clear that He did not bear\nHis own sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:22). When He died, He died as a substi-\ntute for the sins of others. Some have objected that it is immoral for God to\npunish an innocent person for the guilt of another. For these individuals, the\nidea of substitution is unbearable. First, it is not unlawful for a creator and\njudge of a law to pay the penalty he has imposed. Christ is God and thus had\nthe right to pay the penalty for our sins. Second, substitution could only be\nconsidered immoral if Jesus had been forced to be our sacrifice. To the con-\ntrary, Jesus voluntarily laid down His life. Jesus told His disciples, \u201cTherefore\nMy Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again. No\none takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down,\nand I have power to take it again\u201d (John 10:17-18). Believers in Christ are not\nsaved by the murder of Christ but by His willingness to substitute His life for\nthe life of all sinners. The following scriptures clearly demonstrate that Christ\nwas our substitute and bore our sins on the cross:\na) \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one,\nto his own way; And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all\u201d\n(Isa. 53:6).\nb) \u201c\u2026just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,\nand to give His life a ransom for many\u201d (Matt. 20:28).\nc) \u201cFor He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we\nmight become the righteousness of God in Him\u201d (2 Cor. 5:21).\nd) \u201c\u2026who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that\nwe, having died to sins, might live for righteousness\u2014by whose stripes\nyou were healed\u201d (1 Pet. 2:24).\n\ne) \u201cFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that\nHe might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive\nby the Spirit\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 3:18).\nf) See also John 10:11; Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3; Galatians\n2:20.\n2. The death of Christ is an atonement: The word atonement is used in a\ngeneral and a particular manner. As it is popularly used, it refers to the entire\nprovision of salvation that God made for sinners through the sacrifice of the\nLord Jesus Christ. However, atonement also has a very specific meaning in\nScripture. It is an Old Testament word that literally means \u201ca covering.\u201d For\nexample, Leviticus states that a person who trespasses against God should\nbring a \u201ctrespass offering\u201d and \u201c\u2026the priest shall make atonement for him\nbefore the Lord, and he shall be forgiven for any one of these things that\nhe may have done in which he trespasses\u201d (Lev. 6:2-7). Along with individ-\nual sins, it was also possible to make national atonement for national sins\nthrough animal sacrifice (Lev. 4:13-20).\nThe Old Testament concept of atonement is incomplete in describing\nthe work of Christ. In Christ, sins are more than just covered; they are for-\ngiven and completely removed. Hebrews states, \u201cFor it is not possible that the\nblood of bulls and goats could take away sins\u201d (Heb. 10:4). Rather, sanctify-\ning atonement could only come \u201c\u2026through the offering of the body of Jesus\nChrist once for all\u201d (Heb. 10:10).\n3. The death of Christ is a propitiation: The word propitiation signifies\nthe appeasement or turning away of wrath by a sacrifice. Christ\u2019s death was\nthe means of satisfying and removing God\u2019s wrath (Rom. 5:9). God, in His\ngreat love, took the punishment of all sinners upon Himself, thus satisfying\nHis own wrath through the laying down of His own life. \u201cIn this is love, not\nthat we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propiti-\nation for our sins\u201d (1 John 4:10). The following scriptures clearly explain the\nconcept that Jesus is the propitiation for all sin:\n\na) \u201c\u2026being justified freely by His grace through the redemption\nthat is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His\nblood\u2026that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith\nin Jesus\u201d (Rom. 3:24-26).\nb) \u201cAnd He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours\nonly but also for the whole world\u201d (1 John 2:2).\nc) \u201cTherefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren,\nthat He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining\nto God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people\u201d (Heb. 2:17).\n4. The death of Christ is a reconciliation: The word reconciliation means\nto be brought together or restored to a former state of relationship. The\nimmediate result of sin entering the world was distance between God and\nhumanity. After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve \u201chid themselves\nfrom the presence of the LORD God\u201d (Gen. 3:8). In choosing their own way,\nAdam and Eve broke relationship with God. Their rebellion and the sinful\nrebellion of all people led to enmity between God and humans. The sacrifice\nof Jesus Christ has transformed that enmity into peace and fellowship for all\nwho believe by faith. Restored relationship with God is one of the greatest\nblessings of personal salvation. This new relationship magnifies the grace of\nGod, for no man can reconcile himself to God. God Himself has reconciled\nhumanity through the grace gift of Jesus Christ. The following verses clearly\ndemonstrate that the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ has provided a\nway for reconciliation between God and humanity:\na) \u201cFor if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through\nthe death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be\nsaved by His life\u201d (Rom. 5:10).\nb) \u201c\u2026and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him,\nwhether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through\nthe blood of His cross. And you, who once were alienated and enemies\nin your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of\n\nHis flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above\nreproach in His sight\u201d (Col. 1:20-22).\nc) \u201cNow all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself\nthrough Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,\nthat is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not\nimputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of\nreconciliation. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God\nwere pleading through us: we implore you on Christ\u2019s behalf, be recon-\nciled to God\u201d (2 Cor. 5:18-20).\n5. The death of Christ is a redemption: The word redemption signifies\na releasing or liberation from captivity, slavery or death by the payment of a\nprice or ransom. Thus, the word has a double significance: it means the pay-\nment of a price as well as the deliverance of the captive. The death of Christ\non the cross is the price Jesus paid for the redemption and deliverance of\nthe sinner. Jesus proclaimed, \u201c\u2026the Son of Man did not come to be served,\nbut to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many\u201d (Matt. 20:28). Jesus\nobtained this deliverance \u201cNot with the blood of goats and calves, but with\nHis own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained\neternal redemption\u201d (Heb. 9:12). According to the New Testament, believers\nhave redemption from the following:\na) The penalty of the law: Paul made this clear when he wrote,\n\u201cChrist has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse\nfor us (for it is written, \u2019Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree\u2019)\u2026\u201d\n(Gal. 3:13).\nb) The law itself: In Romans Paul stated: \u201cFor sin shall not have domin-\nion over you, for you are not under law but under grace\u201d (Rom. 6:14).\nc) The power of sin in their lives: Romans states, \u201c\u2026Our old man was\ncrucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that\nwe should no longer be slaves of sin\u201d (Rom. 6:6; see also Rom. 6:12-14).\n\nd) All evil in the world: In his letter to the Galatians Paul wrote:\n\u201cChrist obeyed God our Father and gave himself as a sacrifice for our sins\nto rescue us from this evil world\u201d (Gal. 1:4, CEV; see also Rom. 8:23).\nThis final consummation of our redemption will be realized at the sec-\nond coming of Jesus (Luke 21:28).\nC. The community for whom Christ died\nChrist died for all sinners. Some erroneously believe in a limited atone-\nment where Christ died only for the elect He had previously chosen to save.\nA closer look at the scriptural record reveals that the death of Christ was and\nis for all humans.\n1. Christ died for the church. There is no doubt that Christ died for\nthose who are members of His body, the church. Paul wrote \u201cHusbands, love\nyour wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that\nHe might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 5:25-26).\n2. Christ died for the entire world. Scripture teaches that Christ died for\nthe whole world, each and every individual:\na) \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to\nhis own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all\u201d (Isa.\n53:6).\nb) \u201cThe next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said,\n\u2018Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!\u2019\u201d (John\n1:29).\nc) \u201cFor there is one God and one Mediator between God and men,\nthe Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all\u2026\u201d (1 Tim.\n2:5-6).\n\nd) \u201cAnd He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours\nonly but also for the whole world\u201d (1 John 2:2).\nPerhaps the strongest verse against the doctrine of a limited atone-\nment is 2 Peter 2:1: \u201cBut there were also false prophets among the people,\neven as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring\nin destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and\nbring on themselves swift destruction.\u201d This verse positively states that\nChrist bought these false prophets who are pursuing a path that will lead\nto their destruction. In other words, Christ died for these false prophets\neven though they have rejected Christ\u2019s message. In other passages, the\nScripture makes it clear that Christ died for all even though some will\nreject that offering. Paul wrote, \u201cYet if your brother is grieved because\nof your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with\nyour food the one for whom Christ died\u201d (Rom. 14:15). Elsewhere, Paul\nwarned, \u201c\u2026because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for\nwhom Christ died?\u201d (1 Cor. 8:11). In both scriptures, Paul instructed\nbelievers to serve others on the basis that Jesus Christ died for everyone.\nThis is because not a single individual man, woman or child is excluded\nfrom the blessings offered in the atonement. As the author of Hebrews\nstated emphatically, \u201cBut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than\nthe angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that\nHe, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone\u201d (Heb. 2:9).\nSome have asked, \u201cIf Christ died for all, then why are not all saved?\u201d\nThe answer is in the simple but plain truth that each person must expe-\nrience a believing faith in Christ\u2019s death before he or she can participate\nin the benefits of Christ\u2019s death. Jesus said, \u201c\u2026if you do not believe that\nI am He, you will die in your sins\u201d (John 8:24). This principle of per-\nsonal application by faith is illustrated in the details of the Passover night.\nEach Israelite family was to kill a lamb and sprinkle the lamb\u2019s blood\nupon the doorposts and the lintel of their house (Exod. 12). When the\ndeath angel saw the blood applied to a house, he \u201cpassed over\u201d that house\nand did not kill the firstborn inside. In other words, each family had to\napply the blood to be saved from the punishment of death. Likewise, to\n\nbe saved, every individual must personally apply the precious blood of\nChrist through faith.\nThe question arises, does the saving grace of God cover infants and chil-\ndren who die before they come to the age of accountability or moral respon-\nsibility? Since Christ died for all humanity, children are certainly included in\nHis atonement. Ultimately, all adults are judged based on their acceptance\nor rejection of God\u2019s salvation. Jesus said the Holy Spirit would come to\n\u201cconvict the world of sin\u2026because they do not believe in Me\u2026\u201d (John 16:8-\n9). Infants and many children are not able to fully accept, reject or even\nunderstand the plan of God. Consequently, they are not held responsible for\ntheir sin until the age of accountability. Only God knows when children are\nresponsible for their acceptance or rejection of Christ. Even so, the Scripture\ngives a clear example of what happens when children die. The baby David\nhad with Bathsheba died soon after birth. When asked about his response\nto the baby\u2019s death, David said, \u201cCan I bring him back again? I shall go to\nhim, but he shall not return to me\u201d (2 Sam. 12:23). David\u2019s response was a\nconfession that someday he would go to be with his child \u201cin the house of\nthe Lord\u201d (Ps. 23:6).\nD. Misunderstandings about the death of Christ\nIn contrast to the true teachings of Scripture, there are also false theories\nconcerning the death and resurrection of Christ.\n1. The Accident Theory views Christ as simply a man subject to death as\nany other man. According to this theory, Christ died at the hands of a mob\nthat did not agree with His teachings. His death was completely unforeseen\nand had no spiritual significance for anyone. This idea is easily refuted by the\nfact that Christ\u2019s death was foretold throughout the Old Testament (Ps. 22;\nIsa. 53; Zech. 13). Furthermore, Jesus repeatedly spoke of the importance\nand manner of His future death: \u201cNo one takes it from Me, but I lay it down\nof Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again\u201d\n(John 10:18; see also Matt. 16:21; 20:17-19; Mark 9:30-32; Luke 22:19-20).\n\n2. The Martyr Theory or Example Theory holds that the death of Christ\ninvolved no more than the death of a noble martyr, such as Huss or Polycarp.\nAccording to this theory, Christ\u2019s death only has value for humankind as an\nexample to follow. As Christ lived out his life with integrity, so must every\nhuman follow his example. This theory completely ignores the scriptural\nteaching that Christ\u2019s death was a propitiation of God\u2019s wrath and an atone-\nment for humankind\u2019s sin:\n[All who believe are] being justified freely by His grace\nthrough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom\nGod set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through\nfaith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His\nforbearance God had passed over the sins that were pre-\nviously committed, to demonstrate at the present time\nHis righteousness, that He might be just and the justi-\nfier of the one who has faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:24-26).\n3. The Moral Influence or Love of God Theory argues that Christ\u2019s suf-\nfering and death were merely the natural results of Christ becoming flesh\nand suffering with, not for, His creatures. Concerning this theory Thiessen\nwrote: \u201c[It teaches that] the love of God manifested in the incarnation, the\nsufferings and death of Christ, are to soften human hearts and lead them to\nrepentance.\u201d4 According to this theory, there is no thought of the wrath of\nGod to be propitiated or of Christ dying as the substitute for humankind\u2019s\nsins. Although scriptures such as John 3:16 and Romans 5:8 emphasize the\nlove of God, they also clearly reveal how God demonstrated His love. As an\nexpression of His love, God willingly gave His Son to die for the sins of all\nhumanity, satisfying the just demands of His own holiness.\n4. The Governmental Theory states that God made an example of Christ\nin His sufferings to exhibit to humanity His displeasure with sin. In other\nwords, to govern the world, it was necessary for God to show His wrath\nagainst sin so that His law would be respected. This theory argues that people\nrealize God\u2019s attitude toward sin, shown in the sufferings of Christ, and are\n4 Thiessen, 316.\n\nmoved to repentance, which is necessary for salvation. The main objection to\nthis theory is that it does not explain why the incarnation was necessary. It\nalso does not explain why the sufferer had to be an innocent person or why\nGod\u2019s wrath could not have been manifested against any sinner rather than\nHis only begotten Son.\nII. Salvation and the Resurrection of Christ\nThe resurrection of Christ is an essential and glorious component in\nGod\u2019s plan of salvation. Consequently, it is crucial for every believer to have a\nclear understanding of the significance of the resurrection.\nA. The importance of the resurrection of Christ\n1. The resurrection is one of the two primary doctrines of the gospel.\nPaul wrote, \u201c\u2026I declare to you the gospel\u2026that Christ died for our sins\naccording to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again\nthe third day according to the Scriptures\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 15:1-4). The death and\nresurrection of Jesus are both required for the salvation of humankind. If\nChrist had remained in the grave, His death would have only been the death\nof a martyred teacher. Without the vicarious sacrifice of His death, His res-\nurrection would have presented no saving power. The resurrection of Christ\ndemonstrated that Christ was indeed the Son of God. Paul wrote Jesus was\n\u201cdeclared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness,\nby the resurrection from the dead\u201d (Rom. 1:4). Christ\u2019s resurrection proved\nthat His death was sufficient to cover all the sins of humanity. In the resurrec-\ntion, God demonstrated that Jesus Christ was and is the perfect Son of God\n\u201cwho takes away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29).\n2. The resurrection is the foundation stone on which the church is\nbuilt. The resurrection was a central theme in the preaching of the early\nchurch. \u201cAnd with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection\nof the Lord Jesus\u201d (Acts 4:33). The very first sermon preached on the Day of\nPentecost is almost entirely on the theme of the resurrection of Jesus (Acts\n2:22-36). Peter frequently mentioned the resurrection in his proclamations\n\n(Acts 3:15; 4:10). In 1 Corinthians 15:12-19, Paul argued for the central\nimportance of the resurrection by listing what would be true if the resurrec-\ntion were false. Paul argued that if Christ is not risen, the following things\nare true:\na) The believer\u2019s \u201cpreaching is empty\u201d (v.14). The gospel would be\nemptied of its power if Jesus had not gained a victory at Calvary, as evi-\ndenced by His resurrection, over death, hell and the grave. It took the\nvictory of the open tomb and the power of the risen Lord to give effec-\ntuality to the gospel.\nb) The believer\u2019s \u201cfaith is also empty\u201d (v.14). If Christ had not risen\nfrom the dead, divine sonship, eternal life, justification, sanctification,\nglorification and a home in heaven would not be available to believers.\nFaith is always impotent unless the object of that faith gives it power. Paul\nconfirmed this when he wrote, \u201cAnd if Christ is not risen, your faith is\nfutile; you are still in your sins!\u201d (v.17).\nc) The apostles were \u201cfalse witnesses of God\u201d (v.15). An essential\nqualification of apostleship was having witnessed Christ\u2019s resurrection\n(Acts 1:21-22). If Christ had not risen from the dead, these men were\nliars and false witnesses. If Christ was not resurrected, the whole fabric of\nscriptural authenticity is completely torn and invalidated.\nd) Believers are still in their sins (v.17). If Christ did not rise from\nthe grave, He has no more saving efficacy than that of any other great\ncharacter from history. The resurrection of Jesus Christ confirmed the\njustifying value of His death.\ne) Believers \u201cwho have fallen asleep in Christ have perished\u201d (v.18).\nIf the resurrection is a lie, there is no hope for the martyrs or for anyone\nwho dies with faith in Jesus Christ. Paul wrote, \u201cIf in this life only we have\nhope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable\u201d (v.19). With this in\n\nmind, Paul emphatically stated, \u201cBut now Christ is risen from the dead,\nand has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep\u201d (v. 20).5\nB. The nature and manner of Christ\u2019s resurrection\n1. His resurrection was the work of the Trinity.\na) God the Father: Paul unequivocally stated to the people of Antioch\nthat this was true: \u201cBut God raised Him from the dead\u201d (Acts 13:30; see\nalso Acts 2:24; 10:40; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 1:19-20; Col. 2:12).\nb) Jesus Christ: Jesus told \u201c\u2026His disciples that He must go to\nJerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and\nscribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day\u201d (Matt. 16:21). In\nspeaking of laying down His life, Jesus made it clear that \u201cNo one takes it\nfrom Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I\nhave power to take it again\u201d (John 10:18). When speaking of the temple\nof His body, Jesus said, \u201cDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise\nit up\u201d (John 2:19-22). Jesus clearly taught that the resurrection was the\nwill of the Father, the Holy Spirit and the Son.\nc) The Holy Spirit: Paul clearly highlighted the work of the Holy\nSpirit in Jesus\u2019 resurrection: \u201cBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus\nfrom the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will\nalso give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you\u201d\n(Rom. 8:11).\n2. His resurrection was an actual bodily resurrection. Jesus physically\ndied on the cross and was resurrected. The following are proofs of His\nactual death:\n5 Bancroft, 84-87.\n\na) The soldiers saw that He was dead. \u201cBut when they came to Jesus\nand saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs\u201d (John\n19:33).\nb) Blood and water flowed from His side (John 19:34). To ensure\nthat Jesus was dead, one of the soldiers pierced the side of Jesus with his\nlance or spear. The flowing forth of the blood and water is most likely\nphysiological evidence that His heart was ruptured or had burst. 6\nc) The centurion attested to His death (Mark 15:44-45). The cen-\nturion in charge of the crucifixion gave his personal report to Pilate. He\nassured the Roman governor that Jesus was indeed dead.\nd) Joseph of Arimathea placed Him in a tomb (Mark 15:43-46).\nAfter receiving Jesus\u2019 dead body from Pilate, Joseph \u201claid Him in a tomb\nwhich had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door\nof the tomb\u201d (Mark 15:46).\ne) The women who had stood by His cross believed He had died\n(Mark 16:1). On the day of Christ\u2019s resurrection they were heading to the\ntomb with spices to anoint His dead body.\nf) Jesus said that He died. \u201cI am He who lives, and was dead, and\nbehold, I am alive forevermore\u201d (Rev. 1:18).\n3. His resurrection was a bodily resurrection. The word resurrection, as\nused in the New Testament of the Lord Jesus Christ, can only signify the\nresurrection of the body. It is never connected with the spirit, for the spirit\nnever dies. There is abundant proof that the body of Jesus Christ was literally\nraised to life again.\na) His resurrected body was composed of \u201cflesh and bones\u201d (Luke\n24:36-39). Jesus was not an apparition. After the resurrection, He\n6 William Hendriksen, New Testament Commentary Exposition of the Gospel of John, see pp. 437-439.\n\nappeared in a body and invited His disciples to touch Him. \u201c\u2018Behold My\nhands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit\ndoes not have flesh and bones as you see I have\u2019\u201d (Luke 24:39).\nb) His resurrected body could be touched and felt. After His res-\nurrection, the disciples \u201ccame and held Him by the feet and worshiped\nHim\u201d (Matt. 28:9). Jesus \u201csaid to Thomas, \u2018Reach your finger here, and\nlook at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do\nnot be unbelieving, but believing\u2019\u201d (John 20:27).\nc) He ate food after the resurrection. \u201cBut while they still did not\nbelieve for joy, and marveled, He said to them, \u2018Have you any food here?\u2019\nSo they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. And He\ntook it and ate in their presence\u201d (Luke 24:41-43). In eating food, Jesus\nshowed His disciples that he was bodily resurrected.\nd) The disciples and His followers recognized Him (John 20:18-20).\nIt is natural to suppose that the disciples recognized Jesus by His physi-\ncal features.\ne) He appeared in the same body into which the nails had been\ndriven and the spear had been thrust (Luke 24:40; John 20:20). Scripture\nindicates that these same wounds will be visible in His body when He\ncomes again (Zech. 12:10; 13:6; Rev. 1:7).\nf) Jesus had foretold His bodily resurrection. Before His death, Jesus\nproclaimed, \u201c\u2018Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up\u2019\u2026\nHe was speaking of the temple of His body. Therefore, when He had\nrisen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to\nthem; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said\u201d\n(John 2:19-22).\n4. His resurrection was a unique resurrection. Scripture records eight inci-\ndents of people being raised from the dead: the son of the widow at Zarephath\n(1 Kings 17:17-24); the Shunamite woman\u2019s son (2 Kings 4:17-37); the man\n\nwho was laid on the bones of Elisha (2 Kings 13:21); Jairus\u2019 daughter (Mark\n5:22-43); the young man of Nain (Luke 7:11-17); Lazarus (John 11); Tabitha\n(Acts 9:36-43); and Eutychus (Acts 20:7-12). There is every reason to believe\nthat these individuals were not raised in an immortal body, but rather they\ndied again. Jesus\u2019 resurrection was more than a reversal of His death. Paul\nstated, \u201cNow if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with\nHim, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more.\nDeath no longer has dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He\ndied to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God\u201d (Rom.\n6:8-10). In other words, Christ Jesus rose from the grave \u201calive forevermore\u201d\n(Rev. 1:18). It is also important to note that Jesus\u2019 resurrected body is some-\nwhat different from His pre-resurrected body. The resurrected body of Jesus\nappeared to not be bound by some physical limitations. For example, Jesus\ncould enter a room though the doors were shut (John 20:19, 26).\nC. Proofs of Christ\u2019s resurrection\n1. The empty tomb: The angel bore witness that the tomb was empty.\n\u201cHe is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the\nLord lay. And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead\u201d\n(Matt. 28:6-7). The women found the tomb empty (Luke 24:3), and Mary\nMagdalene testified of the same (John 20:2). The soldiers told the story that\nJesus\u2019 body had been stolen but only after they had been bribed to do so\n(Matt. 28:12-15). The disciples were so discouraged and timid it is unlikely\nthey would have stolen the body, which was illegal under Roman law. Nor\nwould they have devoted their lives to propagating such a colossal falsehood.\nFurther, because the chief priest and Pharisees remembered that Jesus had\nsaid, \u201cAfter three days I will rise,\u201d they demanded that the tomb be secured\nand guarded until the third day. The tomb was sealed and watched over by\nguards who were in danger of losing their lives if they had allowed the body\nto be stolen (Matt. 27:62-66).\n2. The grave clothes: The linen burial clothes were lying in the tomb with\nthe handkerchief from His head folded separately (John 20:5-7). Customarily,\nwhen preparing a body for burial, Jews wound long strips of cloth around\nthe body from the neck to the feet. Those strips became saturated with the\n\nweight of the embalming spices (John 19:39-40) and would form a sort of\ncocoon. Jesus\u2019 resurrected body escaped His burial clothes, leaving the clothes\nundisturbed. Only the napkin about the face was removed, possibly to let it\nbe seen that His body was not within. Someone removing the body would\nnot have taken the time to unroll the grave clothes and then restore them to\ntheir previous condition.\n3. The disciples unwavering proclamation: If the resurrection was a lie,\nhistory would most likely have some instance when one or more of the dis-\nciples confessed to lying about the resurrection. Even though many of the\ndisciples and followers of Christ were reputed to have suffered a martyr\u2019s\ndeath for the message they proclaimed, they maintained their conviction that\nthey served and proclaimed a resurrected Savior. No one was able to dissuade\nthem or successfully challenge the validity of their convictions. These con-\nvictions were eventually written down to become sacred Scripture. The New\nTestament is also a clear sign that the disciples experienced the reality of the\nresurrected presence of Jesus Christ.\nD. The results of Christ\u2019s resurrection\n1. Christ\u2019s resurrection provides a firm foundation for faith. It reinforces\nour faith in God, who raised Christ from the dead (1 Pet. 1:21). It reinforces\nour faith that Jesus is all He claimed to be, that He is the very Son of God\n(Rom. 1:4). The resurrection did not turn Jesus into the Son of God but\ndeclared that He was and is the Son of God. When the Jews requested a sign\nby which they might believe, Jesus gave them signs that pointed to His death\nand His resurrection: Jonah being three days and three nights in the fish\u2019s\nbelly (Matt. 12:38-40) and the destruction and rebuilding of the temple of\nHis body (John 2:18-21).\n2. Christ\u2019s resurrection provides an assurance of the forgiveness of sins\nand of justification. Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026that if you confess with your mouth the\nLord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead,\nyou will be saved\u201d (Rom. 10:9). Along with salvation, justification is con-\nfirmed by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, \u201c\u2026who was delivered up because\nof our offenses, and was raised because of our justification\u201d (Rom. 4:25). The\n\nresurrection gives believers confidence that God was satisfied with the sacri-\nfice Christ made on behalf of all sinners. Indeed, Peter wrote that the new\nbirth is accomplished because of Christ\u2019s resurrection: \u201cBlessed be the God\nand Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy\nhas begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ\nfrom the dead\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 1:3).\n3. Christ\u2019s resurrection provides individuals with a merciful and faithful\nhigh priest in heaven (Heb. 2:17). Paul clearly referred to the ministry of a\nhigh priest when he wrote, \u201cWho is he who condemns? It is Christ who died,\nand furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also\nmakes intercession for us\u201d (Rom. 8:34).\n4. Christ\u2019s resurrection assures believers of necessary power for life and\nservice. Paul wrote that his genuine desire was \u201c\u2026that I may know Him\n[Christ] and the power of His resurrection\u2026\u201d (Phil. 3:10). God\u2019s deliverance\nof the children of Israel from Egypt was a great miracle that stirred the faith\nof His chosen people. In the New Testament, the greatest demonstration of\nGod\u2019s power is the raising of Jesus Christ from the dead. Indeed, the resur-\nrection of Jesus seems to be the yardstick by which God\u2019s power is measured.\nPaul prayed that the saints at Ephesus might know God\u2019s amazing power \u201c\u2026\nwhich He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated\nHim at His right hand in the heavenly places\u201d (Eph. 1:20). This was the\npower that defeated death and is sufficient for every day and every emergency.\n5. Christ\u2019s resurrection ensures the resurrection and immortality of believ-\ners. \u201c\u2026We also believe and therefore speak, knowing that He who raised up\nthe Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you\u201d (2\nCor. 4:13-14). Christ defeated death not by avoiding it but by enduring and\nconquering it and swallowing it up in victory (1 Cor. 15:54-57). His death\nenabled him to destroy \u201c\u2026him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,\nand release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to\nbondage\u201d (Heb. 2:14-15).\n6. Christ\u2019s resurrection provides the certainty of a day of judgment: There\nwill come a day of judgment for both the godly and the ungodly. \u201cTruly, these\n\ntimes of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere\nto repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world\nin righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance\nof this to all by raising Him from the dead\u201d (Acts 17:31; see also John 5:22,\n25-29; Acts 10:42).\nIII. Salvation and Christ\u2019s Ascension and Glorification\nA. His ascension\nThe ascension refers to when the resurrected Christ was visibly taken into\nheaven. Jesus predicted His ascension when He told Mary, \u201cDo not cling to\nMe, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say\nto them, \u2018I am ascending to My Father and Your Father, and to My God and\nyour God\u2019\u201d (John 20:17; see also John 13:1; 16:10, 16, 28). Mark testified to\nthe ascension when he wrote, \u201c\u2026after the Lord had spoken to them, He was\nreceived up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God\u201d (Mark 16:9).\nLuke described the ascension in both the gospel of Luke and Acts: \u201cAnd He\nled them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.\nNow it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them\nand carried up into heaven\u201d (Luke 24:50-51; see also Acts 1:9). Paul and the\nauthor of Hebrews also taught the ascension of Christ (Eph. 4:8-10; 1 Tim.\n3:16; Heb. 4:14; 7:26).\nMyer Pearlman made the following observation regarding the ascension:\nThus the ascension becomes the dividing line of two\nperiods of Christ\u2019s life: From birth to the resurrection\nHe is the Christ of human history, the One Who lived\na perfect human life under earthly conditions. Since\nthe ascension He is the Christ of spiritual experience,\nwho lives in heaven and touches men through the\nHoly Spirit.7\n7 Pearlman, 176.\n\nB. His exaltation\n1. The meaning of the exaltation of Christ: The exaltation of Christ refers\nto when the Father gave the risen and ascended Son the place of honor, power\nand authority at His right hand. This concept is found in various places\nthroughout the New Testament:\na) \u201cTherefore being exalted to the right hand of God\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:33).\nb) \u201cHim God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and\nSavior\u2026\u201d (Acts 5:31).\nc) \u201c\u2026Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right\nhand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made sub-\nject to Him\u201d (1 Pet. 3:21-22).\nd) \u201cIt is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even\nat the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us\u201d (Rom.\n8:34).\ne) \u201cTherefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the\nname which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee\nshould bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under\nthe earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,\nto the glory of God the Father\u201d (Phil. 2:9-11).\n2. The results of Christ\u2019s exaltation: The exaltation of Christ has signifi-\ncant implications for believers.\na) Christ is now humanity\u2019s high priest who appears in the Father\u2019s\npresence on behalf of all humans. \u201cSeeing then that we have a great High\nPriest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us\nhold fast our confession\u201d (Heb. 4:14).\n\nb) Believers are assured access to God. \u201cSeeing then that we have a\ngreat High Priest\u2026Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace,\nthat we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need (Heb.\n4:14-16).\nc) Christ is the head of the church. \u201cAnd He put all things under\nHis feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church\u2026\u201d (Eph.\n1:22). \u201cAnd He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning,\nthe firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preemi-\nnence\u201d (Col. 1:18).\nd) The Holy Spirit has been outpoured. \u201cNevertheless I tell you the\ntruth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the\nHelper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you\u201d\n(John 16:7). \u201cTherefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and hav-\ning received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured\nout this which you now see and hear\u201d (Acts 2:33).\ne) He now gives gifts to believers (Eph. 4:7-12; see also 1 Cor.\n12:8-11).\nf) He is preparing a place for believers before He returns. \u201cI go to\nprepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will\ncome again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be\nalso\u201d (John 14:2-3).\nC. Practical effects of the doctrines of ascension and glorification\nMyer Pearlman identified five, very practical and inspiring values rooted\nin the truth that Christ has ascended and is seated in the place of honor at the\nFather\u2019s right hand.8\n8 PearIman, 181.\n\n1. Consciousness of the ascended Christ is an incentive to holiness (Col.\n3:1-4). As believers look upward in expectation of His return, the downward\npull of this world is counteracted.\n2. Knowledge of Christ\u2019s ascension makes for a right conception of the\nchurch. A proper understanding of Christ\u2019s ascension leads to the recognition\nof the church as a supernatural organism that derives divine life from its\nrisen head.\n3. Awareness of the ascended Christ gives proper perspective of the world\nand worldly things. \u201cFor our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also\neagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Phil. 3:20).\n4. Faith in the ascended Christ inspires a deep sense of personal respon-\nsibility. The awareness that every person will stand before Christ someday\nserves as a deterrent to sin and an incentive to righteousness (Rom. 14:79; 2\nCor. 5:9-10; Eph. 6:9).\n5. Confidence in Christ\u2019s ascension leads to a joyous hope of His return:\n\u201cAnd if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to\nMyself; that where I am, there you may be also\u201d (John 14:3).\nIV. Salvation and the Sovereignty of God\nThe work of salvation begins and ends with God. Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026even\nwhen we were dead in trespasses, [God] made us alive together with Christ\u2026\nFor by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves;\nit is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast\u201d (Eph. 2:4-9; see\nalso Col. 2:13). In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026while we were\nstill sinners, Christ died for us\u2026[while] we were enemies we were reconciled\nto God through the death of His Son\u2026\u201d (Rom. 5:8, 10). God in His sover-\neign love gave His Son as a sacrifice for all sin even when all had turned away\nfrom God (Rom. 3:11-12). Consequently, salvation is a gift from God that is\nestablished and sustained by God.\n\nIn contemplating the doctrine of salvation, there has been great con-\nfusion concerning the relationship between God\u2019s sovereignty and human-\nkind\u2019s free will. Although Scripture clearly states that God is sovereign, it also\nteaches that humans are responsible for their acceptance or rejection of God\u2019s\nsalvation (John 3:16). In other words, God in His sovereignty will not violate\nHis creation\u2019s essential freedom. Even so, various theological convictions and\ncamps have formed around the interplay between the limited perspective of\nfinite humans and the infinite perspective of an eternal God. One such area of\nstrong confusion and disagreement surrounds the idea or doctrine of election.\nThe doctrine of election ultimately revolves around passages that use the\nwords \u201ccalled,\u201d \u201cchosen,\u201d \u201cpredestined\u201d or \u201cthe elect\u201d to refer to believers and\nthe saving work of Christ (see Rom. 8:28-30; Eph. 1:3-11; 1 Pet. 1:1-2). One\nof the key issues of contention in these passages is whether or not believers\nhave a choice within the plan of God\u2019s election. Is election an issue of God\npredetermining who will and won\u2019t be saved, or is election rooted in God\u2019s\nforeknowledge of who will receive or reject His gift of salvation?\nAn extreme view of election can lead to the conclusion that the elect will\nbe saved regardless of their response to the gospel, while those who are not\nchosen by God will be lost eternally, regardless of their endeavor to come to\nGod through faith in Christ. This extreme, errant view of election is based\non the doctrines of \u201cunconditional election\u201d\u2014that the elect are chosen com-\npletely apart from any repentance or faith on their part, and \u201climited atone-\nment\u201d\u2014that Christ did not die for all humankind but only for those He has\nchosen. This view ultimately believes that Christ did not \u201csincerely call\u201d all\nhumans to follow Him, but rather He \u201cefficiently called\u201d only those He had\npreviously elected for salvation. This view ultimately contradicts many scrip-\ntures that point to Jesus as the offering for all sin and all sinners. The words\nof John the Baptist contradict the very heart of this so call limited atonement,\n\u201cBehold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!\u201d (John\n1:29). For the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world, the opportu-\nnity for the new birth must be for all people, not just for a limited few chosen\nin advance by God.\n\nWithin this debate it is important to distinguish between God\u2019s fore-\nknowledge and His foreordaining. Romans states, \u201cFor whom He foreknew,\nHe also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son\u2026\u201d (Rom.\n8:29). To believe that God foreknew all things is not the same as believing He\narbitrarily determined the outcome of all things. God in His foreknowledge\nlooks ahead to events much as we look back upon them. His foreknowledge\nis not causative; it does not change the nature of an event any more than\nhindsight changes an historical fact. There is a difference between what God\ndetermines to bring to pass and what He merely permits to happen. Thiessen\nexplained this concept:\nCertainly only few who hold the view of \u201cunconditional\nelection\u201d would teach that God is the efficient cause of\nsin: practically all would agree that God merely permit-\nted sin to enter the universe, and all would admit that\nHe foresaw that it would enter, before He created any-\nthing. If, then, God could foresee that sin would enter\nthe universe without efficiently decreeing that it should\nenter, then He can also foresee how men will act with-\nout efficiently decreeing how they shall act.9\nScripture states that believers were chosen \u201cin Christ\u201d:\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwho has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the\nheavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him\nbefore the foundation of the world, that we should\nbe holy and without blame before Him in love, hav-\ning predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ\nto Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will\n(Eph. 1:3-5).\nHaving chosen His own \u201cin Christ,\u201d God does not look at people in\nthemselves but as they are in Christ. Christ is the Chosen One; He is both\n9 Thiessen, 346.\n\nthe subject and the object of election. Those who were chosen are those who\nwere in Christ. Those who are in Christ have believed in the redeeming blood\nof Christ through which they have been united with Him as members of\nHis body. Believers were foreseen by God in Christ when He chose them.\nGod did not determine who should be there. He simply saw them there in\nChrist when He chose them. The Bible does not teach selection but election.\nNowhere does the Bible teach that some are predestined to be damned. It is\nnot a person\u2019s nonelection that leads to eternal ruin; it is sin and failure to\naccept Jesus Christ. All people are free to accept Christ as Savior. In fact, they\nare urged to do so (Acts 17:30; Heb. 2:9).\nV. Salvation and the Necessity of Repentance and Faith\nA. Repentance\nRepentance is necessary for salvation. Repentance is a sincere and thor-\nough changing of the mind and purpose in regard to God, self and sin.\nRepentance is the will of God for every person: \u201cThe Lord is not slack con-\ncerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,\nnot willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance\u201d (2\nPet. 3:9). Furthermore, repentance is commanded by the Lord: \u201cTruly, these\ntimes of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere\nto repent\u201d (Acts 17:30). True repentance includes an intellectual, emotional\nand volitional aspect.\n1. Aspects of repentance\na) The intellectual aspect of repentance: In repenting, the individual\nhas a change of view in regard to sin, God and self. The individual comes\nto recognize sin not merely as a weakness, a mistake or an unfortunate\nhappening, but as a personal guilt (Ps. 51:3). The sinner recognizes that\nhis or her sin is a transgression against God. David testified to this truth\nwhen he realized his sin against Bathsheba and her husband, Uriah, was\nalso sin against God\u2019s law. David lamented, \u201cAgainst You, You only, have\n\nI sinned, And done this evil in Your sight\u2026\u201d (Ps. 51:4). Another intel-\nlectual aspect of repentance is found in the sinner recognizing that sin\ndefiles and pollutes his or her own being. Recognizing this truth, David\nprayed for God\u2019s cleansing (Ps. 51:7).\nb) The emotional aspect of repentance: In repenting, the individual\nhas a deep, profound, godly sorrow for sin. Paul told the believers at\nCorinth that \u201cgodly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation\u201d (2\nCor. 7:10). Jesus spoke of the tax collector who \u201c\u2026would not so much\nas raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, \u2018God, be merciful\nto me a sinner!\u2019\u201d (Luke 18:13). There is a real stirring of the heart when\na person is brought face to face with his or her own sin. However, there\nis a difference between experiencing true sorrow for sin versus having the\nmere feeling of shame. There is a vast difference between remorse and\nrepentance. A person may merely be sorry to have been caught in the act\nof sin and not truly repentant because of sin. Godly sorrow will lead to\ngenuine repentance.\nc) The volitional aspect of repentance: In repenting, the individual\nexercises his or her will by turning from sin and wholeheartedly turning\nto Christ for forgiveness. One of the words used for \u201crepentance\u201d means\nto turn. This is illustrated in the story of the prodigal son who exer-\ncised his will and returned to his father (Luke 15:18-21). As repentance\ntouches the will, it will result in the following:\n(1) Confessing sin: \u201cFor I will declare my iniquity; I will be in\nanguish over my sin\u201d (Ps. 38:18).\n(2) Forsaking sin: \u201cHe who covers his sins will not prosper, But who-\never confesses and forsakes them will have mercy\u201d (Prov. 28:13).\n(3) Turning to God: \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, And the unrigh-\nteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the LORD\u2026\u201d (Isa. 55:7).\n\n(4) Surrendering to God: \u201cThen Jesus said to His disciples, \u201cIf anyone\ndesires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and\nfollow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses\nhis life for My sake will find it\u201d (Matt. 16:24-25).\n2. Importance of repentance\na) Repentance is central to the Great Commission: \u201cThen He said to\nthem, \u2018Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer\nand to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remis-\nsion of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at\nJerusalem\u201d (Luke 24:46-47).\nb) Repentance is a central teaching of the New Testament church:\n\u201cThen Peter said to them, \u2018Repent, and let every one of you be baptized\nin the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins\u2026\u2019\u201d (Acts 2:38).\n\u201cI kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and\ntaught you publicly and from house to house, testifying to Jews, and\nalso to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus\nChrist\u201d (Acts 20:20-21; see also Acts 3:19; 5:31; 8:22; 11:18; 26:20; 2\nCor. 12:21; 2 Tim. 2:25).\nc) Repentance is the will of God for every person: \u201cThe Lord is not\nslack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffer-\ning toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come\nto repentance\u201d (2 Pet. 3:9).\nd) Repentance is the command of God for every person: \u201cTruly,\nthese times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men\neverywhere to repent\u2026\u201d (Acts 17:30).\ne) Failure to repent will result in eternal death: \u201cI tell you, no; but\nunless you repent you will all likewise perish\u201d (Luke 13:3).\n\nf) Repentance brings joy in Heaven: \u201cI say to you that likewise there\nwill be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-\nnine just persons who need no repentance\u2026I say to you, there is joy in the\npresence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents\u201d (Luke 15:7, 10).\n3. The source of repentance: Miracles in and of themselves do not pro-\nduce repentance. Matthew records Jesus lamenting this truth: \u201cThen He\nbegan to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done,\nbecause they did not repent: \u2018Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!\nFor if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and\nSidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes\u2019\u201d (Matt.\n11:20-21). In the story of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus taught that unre-\npentant people will not turn to God even if a loved one came back from the\ndead to warn them: \u201c\u2026If they [the unrepentant] do not hear Moses and\nthe prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead\u201d\n(Luke 16:30-31). Powerful teaching and mighty miracles are not the source\nof repentance.\na) Repentance is a gift from God. After Peter explained why the\nGentiles had been included in God\u2019s plan of salvation, \u201c\u2026they glorified\nGod, saying, \u2018Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to\nlife\u2019\u201d (Acts 11:18). Paul encouraged Timothy to instruct people in the\nknowledge of God so that \u201cGod perhaps will grant them repentance\u201d\n(2 Tim 2:25). Repentance is not something individuals can bring about\nthemselves. Individuals who believe they can live for themselves and\nrepent when they are ready are sadly mistaken. Since repentance is a gift\nfrom God, individuals should turn to God the moment they have an\nurge to repent of their sins.\nb) Repentance accompanies the Spirit-led preaching of the gospel.\nOn the day of Pentecost, Peter and the disciples were filled with the Holy\nSpirit. In response to Peter\u2019s Spirit-empowered gospel message \u201c\u2026they\nwere cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \u2018Men\nand brethren, what shall we do?\u2019 Then Peter said to them, \u2018Repent, and\n\nlet every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remis-\nsion of sins\u2026\u2019\u201d (Acts 2:37-38).\nc) Repentance is the fruit of God\u2019s goodness and patience. Paul\nreminded the Romans \u201c\u2026that the goodness of God leads you to repen-\ntance\u201d (Rom 2:4). Peter proclaimed that God \u201c\u2026is longsuffering towards\nus, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repen-\ntance\u201d (2 Pet. 3:9).\nRepentance is not based upon the wisdom of humans but the\npatience and goodness of God. Repentance is a gift from God that is\nfrequently accompanied by Spirit-empowered proclamation and living.\nAs a gift from God, repentance can be received or rejected. In the work\nof salvation, repentance must also be accompanied by faith.\nB. Faith\nAlong with repentance, faith is necessary for an individual to receive sal-\nvation. Faith and repentance are so intertwined it is difficult to determine\nwhich comes first in the work of salvation. It is doubtful that individuals\ncan repent unless they believe or can believe unless they sincerely repent.\nRegardless, it is not possible to overstate the importance of faith in the\nChristian life and the work of salvation. Faith is how individuals approach\nGod. \u201cBut without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to\nGod must believe that He is, and the He is a rewarder of those who diligently\nseek Him\u201d (Heb. 11:6). Ultimately, everything believers receive from God\nthey receive through faith. The role of faith and belief in salvation is a central\ntheme throughout Scripture.\n(1) \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of\nyourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast\u201d\n(Eph. 2:8-9).\n(2) \u201cHe who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does\nnot believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16).\n\n(3) \u201cSo they said, \u2018Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be\nsaved, you and your household\u2019\u201d (Acts 16:31).\n(4) \u201cBut to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies\nthe ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness\u2026\u201d (Rom. 4:5).\n(5) \u201cTherefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Rom. 5:1).\n(6) \u201cBut we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those\nwho believe to the saving of the soul\u201d (Heb. 10:39).\n(7) \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes\nin Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judg-\nment, but has passed from death into life\u201d (John 5:24).\n1. Meaning of faith\nThe author of Hebrews gave what is possibly the best definition of faith:\n\u201cNow faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not\nseen\u201d (Heb. 11:1). In this scripture, faith is said to be the \u201csubstance.\u201d The\nword \u201csubstance\u201d comes from a word that literally means \u201cfoundation\u201d or that\nwhich underlies our hope. \u201cFoundation\u201d speaks of that covenant relationship\nof mutual love between the Lord and the believer. Faith is not blind groping\nin the dark but the certain conviction, born of love and relationship, that\nGod\u2019s revealed word is true. Faith is more than mere hope; it is \u201csubstance,\u201d\nwhich in legal affairs was translated \u201ctitle deed.\u201d He who has the substance of\nfaith has a \u201ctitle deed\u201d to God\u2019s full provision.\nThe realities of God\u2019s kingdom are invisible realities to the natural eye.\nFaith is the faculty by which the spiritual realities are perceived as being real\nand capable of being realized. For Christians, faith is real \u201cevidence.\u201d Believers\ndo not need other evidence to proceed in accord with the revealed will of\nGod. In relationship to salvation, faith is based upon what God has done and\npromised through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is based\n\nentirely on the finished work of Christ as revealed in Scripture and confirmed\nby the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:14-39). As with repentance, true faith\nincludes an intellectual, emotional and volitional aspect.\n2. Aspects of faith\na) The intellectual aspect: Faith is not a blind leap into the dark.\nInstead, faith is walking in the light\u2014the light of God\u2019s word. Faith must\nbe based on knowledge. No one can believe in something or someone of\nwhich they have no knowledge. Faith for salvation is based on the very\nbest evidence: the word of God revealed in Scripture and enlivened by\nthe power of the Holy Spirit. \u201cConsequently, faith comes from hearing\nthe message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ\u201d\n(Rom. 10:17, NIV).\nb) The emotional aspect: This element is seen in the joy believers\nexperience when they first realize the goodness of God. This joy can wane\nwhen believers fail to grow in their relationship with God. Jesus gave this\nexample in the parable of the sower scattering seeds: \u201cOthers, like seed\nsown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But\nsince they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or\npersecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away\u201d (Mark\n4:16-17, NIV). Jesus\u2019 warning demonstrates that emotions must always\nbe balanced by the truth or fact of faith. Dr. A.T. Pierson stated: \u201cHere\nis the order: Fact leads. Faith with its eye on Fact following. Feeling with\nits eye on Faith brings up the rear. All goes well as long as this order is\nobserved. But the moment that Faith turns its back on Fact and looks at\nFeeling the procession wobbles.\u201d10 Thiessen summarized the emotional\nand intellectual reality of faith well: \u201cWe may define the emotional ele-\nment of faith as the awakening of the soul to its personal needs and to\nthe personal applicability of the redemption provided in Christ, together\nwith an immediate assent to these truths.\u201d11\n10 Arthur T. Pierson,The Bible and Spiritual Life (New York: Gospel Publishing House,1908) n.p.\n11 Thiessen, 358.\n\nc) The volitional aspect: After knowing what God has promised, after\nassenting to the truth of that promise, faith reaches out and appropriates\nwhat is provided. Knowledge itself is not enough. Individuals may have\nthe knowledge that Christ is divine yet still reject Christ as their Savior.\nKnowledge can affirm a reality, but it does not accept or reject that real-\nity. This is also true of assent or agreement. It is possible for individuals\nto assent with their minds yet not surrender with their hearts. Real faith\nis demonstrated in the realm of the will. Real faith appropriates and acts\nupon the promises of God. Consequently, faith must always be put into\naction (Jas. 2:14). It is the soul leaping up to embrace the promise, \u201c\u2026\nbeing fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised\u201d\n(Rom. 4:21, NIV).\nThe volitional aspects of saving faith require that sinners surrender\ntheir hearts to God and appropriate Christ as their Savior. Paul wrote,\n\u201c\u2026that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in\nyour heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d\n(Rom. 10:9). This passage teaches that saving faith is found in surren-\ndering to the Lordship of Jesus. To appropriate Christ as their Savior,\nindividuals must fully receive all that Christ has done for the redemp-\ntion of their souls: \u201cBut as many as received Him, to them He gave the\nright to become children of God, to those who believe in His name\u2026\u201d\n(John 1:12).\nUltimately, salvation requires that each person make a personal deci-\nsion to receive Jesus Christ. This personal appropriation is a vital necessity.\nAlthough Jesus died for all, each person must individually accept Christ as\nhis or her own Savior. Water is provided for all, but if individuals do not per-\nsonally drink from the life-giving flow, they will die. Air is provided for all,\nbut everyone must breathe to survive. The Bible teaches that for salvation to\noccur there must be an individual commitment of the soul to Christ and a\npersonal acceptance of Christ as both Savior and Lord. \u201cFor \u2018whoever calls on\nthe name of the LORD shall be saved\u2019\u201d (Rom. 10:13).\n\n3. Receiving saving faith\nWhen individuals receive salvation by faith, their decision is based on\nwhat God has promised and done. Faith that leads to salvation is not the\nwork of the individual but rather a gift from God (Eph. 2:8). Saving faith\nis based entirely on the finished work of Christ as revealed in the Scripture.\nConsequently, saving faith is experienced when individuals simply believe in\nwhat God has said and take Him at His word. To sinful humans the gospel\nof grace often sounds too good to be true. There is an assumption that one\nneeds more than repentance and faith to be truly saved. Even so, Scripture\nclearly states that the good news of the gospel has been promised, planned\nand brought about by God. Therefore, every person can take God at His\nword and receive His gift of salvation by faith.\nVI. Salvation and the Process of Justification\nJustification is the foundational truth of God\u2019s provision of salvation\nfor guilty sinners. Justification by faith is a great truth that the Protestant\nReformation restored to the Christian church. Although frequently referred\nto in Scripture, justification is an often neglected and misunderstood doctrine.\nJustification and regeneration are closely related doctrines. Regeneration is\nwhat takes place in the believer\u2019s heart; justification concerns the believer\u2019s\nstanding before God. Regeneration refers to the impartation of life, while jus-\ntification refers to being declared righteous in the eyes of God. Regeneration\nis the divine answer to the problem of spiritual death; justification is the\ndivine answer to the problem of guilt.\nJustification is the act whereby God declares individuals righteous. It is\na legal term that evokes the concept of a lawbreaker waiting to receive the\ndeserved judgment. Instead of being condemned by the judge, the person\nis judicially pronounced not guilty, being declared righteous. It is not that\nthe sinner is righteous, but that the sinner is declared righteous on the basis\nof faith in the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. Justification is more than\nthe forgiving or pardoning of sins; it is more than the removal of guilt and\ncondemnation. Justification is also God reckoning an individual\u2019s account\n\nwith the perfect righteousness of Christ. Scripture states, Christ \u201c\u2026became\nfor us wisdom from God\u2014and righteousness and sanctification and redemp-\ntion\u2014\u201d (1 Cor. 1:30). \u201cFor He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for\nus, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him\u201d (2 Cor. 5:21).\nJustification includes deliverance from God\u2019s wrath as well as righteousness\nand acceptance in His sight. When God justifies a person, He wipes out the\nrecord of sin and guilt in that individual\u2019s life. In the eyes of God, it is as\nthough that individual has never sinned.\nA. The method of justification\nIt is very important for individuals to understand the method by which\nGod justifies sinners. Justification makes it possible for Christians to stand\nbefore God. God cannot merely overlook sin because of His compassion.\nOtherwise, He would violate His own holiness and justice. He must \u201c\u2026be\njust and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus\u201d (Rom. 3:26). There is\na definite and divine way by which sinners are declared righteous. Apart from\nthis way there is no possibility for justification.\n1. Not by works: Humans are not justified on the basis of their own\nrighteousness or good deeds. This is made abundantly clear throughout the\nScripture. In Romans, Paul wrote that Abraham was not justified by works\nbut by faith: \u201cFor what does the Scripture say? \u2018Abraham believed God, and it\nwas accounted to him for righteousness.\u2019 Now to him who works, the wages\nare not counted as grace but as debt. But to him who does not work but\nbelieves on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righ-\nteousness\u2026\u201d (Rom. 4:3-5).\n2. Not by keeping the law: Humans are not justified on the basis of\ntheir ability to follow and obey God\u2019s law. Paul made this clear in his letter\nto the Romans: \u201cTherefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified\nin His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin\u2026for all have sinned and\nfall short of the glory of God\u2026\u201d (Rom. 3:20, 23). In Galatians this truth\nis repeated, \u201c\u2026for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified\u201d (Gal.\n2:16). Theoretically, to be justified by God\u2019s law, an individual would need\nto follow God\u2019s law perfectly. Since no human has followed or can follow\n\nGod\u2019s law completely, all humans under the law are under a curse outside\nof the redemptive work of Jesus. \u201cFor as many as are of the works of the\nlaw are under the curse; for it is written, \u2018Cursed is everyone who does not\ncontinue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them\u2019\u201d\n(Gal. 3:10).\nIt is important to realize that there is nothing wrong with the law itself.\nPaul wrote, \u201c\u2026the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and\ngood\u201d (Rom. 7:12). The law serves to make humans realize they are sinners,\n\u201c\u2026for by the law is the knowledge of sin\u201d (Rom. 3:20). Ultimately, the law\nreveals to individuals their need for justification apart from keeping the law.\n3. By the gift of God\u2019s grace: Justification is only received through God\u2019s\ngrace. It cannot be worked for or merited. Paul wrote that every believer\nis \u201c\u2026justified freely by His grace though the redemption that is in Christ\nJesus\u2026\u201d (Rom. 3:24; see also Tit. 3:7). Grace comes from the Greek charis\nand originally meant \u201cbeauty\u201d or \u201cbeautiful conduct.\u201d Later it was used\nto mean any favor granted to another, especially when the recipient had\nnot merited such a favor. In the New Testament, charis or grace, is usually\nassociated with God granting forgiveness to sinners who have done nothing\nto deserve the forgiveness of their sins. Grace blesses more than just unde-\nserving sinners; it saves the enemies of God. Grace is more than an action\nGod expresses. Grace is an essential part of God\u2019s very nature. Justification\nis the grace gift of God.\n4. Through the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ: God does not\nforgive the sins of humans just because He is gracious. He does not and\ncannot merely overlook sin. God is just, and His pardon is based upon the\nstrict terms of justice. Jesus Christ has paid the penalty for every individual\u2019s\nsin. Rather than punishing individuals for their sins, Jesus Christ took their\npunishment upon Himself. In other words, He brought justice to sinners by\ntaking their place. In taking the place of sinners, Jesus fulfilled the righteous\nrequirements of God. Scripture says, \u201cFor He made Him who knew no sin\nto be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him\u201d (2\nCor. 5:21). Because of Christ\u2019s sacrifice, God can forgive sin because the law\nhas been fulfilled and the penalty has been paid. Not only did Christ pay the\n\npenalty for every person\u2019s rebellion, He also perfectly obeyed the law provid-\ning a righteousness that God could credit to every individual\u2019s account. \u201cFor\nas by one man\u2019s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s\nobedience many will be made righteous\u201d (Rom. 5:19). Christ not only took\nthe sins of all humanity upon Himself but also bestowed His righteousness\nupon all who believe. This seemingly unbelievable exchange is what God\noffers to all who believe in the work of the cross.\n5. Through faith: Justification is a grace gift received through faith.\nScripture repeatedly points to the role of faith in justification:\na) \u201c\u2026Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption\nthat is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His\nblood, through faith\u2026to demonstrate at the present time His righteous-\nness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in\nJesus\u201d (Rom. 3:24, 26).\nb) \u201cBut to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies\nthe ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness\u2026\u201d (Rom. 4:5).\nc) \u201cTherefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with\nGod through our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Rom. 5:1).\nd) \u201c\u2026knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law\nbut by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we\nmight be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for\nby the works of the law no flesh shall be justified\u201d (Gal. 2:16).\nWhen individuals declare that they are justified through faith, they must\nrealize that faith is not a meritorious offer they make to God for salvation.\nFaith is only the means through which individuals receive God\u2019s gracious\nprovision (Rom. 5:1). Thiessen wrote, \u201cWe are not saved for our faith, but\nthrough our faith.\u201d12\n12 Thiessen, 382.\n\nB. Elements involved in justification\n1. Forgiveness or remission of sins: Because all the sins of the believer are\nforgiven, the guilt and punishment of those sins are also removed.\na) \u201cTherefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this\nMan is preached to you the forgiveness of sins; and by Him everyone\nwho believes is justified from all things from which you could not be\njustified by the law of Moses\u201d (Acts 13:38-39).\nb) \u201cIn Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness\nof sins, according to the riches of His grace\u2026\u201d (Eph. 1:7).\nc) \u201cAnd you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision\nof your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you\nall trespasses\u2026\u201d (Col. 2:13).\n2. Restoration of God\u2019s favor: Sinners are subject to God\u2019s wrath. \u201cHe\nwho believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe\nthe Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him\u201d (John 3:36).\nThose who have been justified have been released from wrath: \u201cMuch more\nthen, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath\nthrough Him\u201d (Rom. 5:9). Justification means that believers are not only\nsaved from God\u2019s wrath but also blessed with the favor of God.\na) \u201cTherefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with\nGod through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access\nby faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory\nof God\u201d (Rom. 5:1-2).\nb) \u201cBut when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward\nman appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but\naccording to His mercy He saved us\u2026that having been justified by His\ngrace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life (Tit.\n3:4, 7).\n\nThe grace of God is so abundant that believers are received into His\nfavor as though they had never broken His laws. The favor of God is\nmore than the pardoning or overlooking of sins; it is the complete res-\ntoration of a lost sinner. The parable of the prodigal son illustrates this\nkind of favor and restoration. In complete love and acceptance, the father\nwelcomes back his wayward son, \u201c\u2026for this my son was dead and is\nalive again; he was lost and is found\u201d (Luke 15:24). P.B. Fitzwater wrote,\n\u201c\u2026Justification is much more than remission of sins or acquittal. The\njustified man is more than a discharged criminal. He is restored to the\nposition of one who is righteous. God treats him as though he had never\nsinned.\u201d13 The fruit of justification is the abiding favor of God.\n3. Imputation of Christ\u2019s righteousness: God justifies individuals by sup-\nplying believers with the positive or imputed righteousness of Christ. All fel-\nlowship with a holy God must be on the basis of righteousness. Scripture\ndeclares that outside the work of Christ \u201cThere is none righteous, no, not\none\u2026\u201d (Rom. 3:10). However, through Christ, \u201c\u2026now the righteousness of\nGod apart from the law is revealed\u2026\u201d (Rom. 3:21). In Christ, believers are\nmade righteous, \u201cFor He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we\nmight become the righteousness of God in Him\u201d (2 Cor. 5:21). These verses\nsuggest that in justification there is a double imputation: the sins of sinners\nare imputed to the sinless Christ, while the righteousness of Christ is imputed\nto unrighteous sinners. It is important to note that justification does not nec-\nessarily change the behavior of the individual. Rather, justification reckons\nto sinners the righteousness of Christ so that God sees believers through the\nperfect righteousness of His son Jesus.\nThe ultimate guarantee of the believer\u2019s justification is the resurrection\nof Christ, \u201c\u2026who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised\nbecause of our justification\u201d (Rom. 4:25). The fact that God raised Jesus from\nthe dead testifies to the truth that Jesus\u2019 sacrifice paid the price for all sin. The\nresurrection of Jesus declares that all our sins, which He took upon Himself,\nare forgiven. The resurrection is the Father\u2019s seal of approval upon Christ\u2019s\natoning death. Those who believe in Christ receive the fullness of God\u2019s justi-\nfication. In Christ, every believer is justified equally and completely.\n13 Fitzwater, 47.\n\nVII. Salvation and the Process of Regeneration\nRegeneration is the spiritual rebirth of an individual that occurs at\nconversion through the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus told\nNicodemus that new birth is necessary for anyone to enter the kingdom of\nGod: \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see\nthe kingdom of God\u201d (John 3:3). Through the saving work of Jesus Christ,\npeople are born again into new life.\nA. Characteristics of the new birth\n1. The new birth is a real birth: John stated, \u201cWhoever believes that\nJesus is the Christ is born of God\u2026\u201d (1 John 5:1). The new birth is not the\nchanging of one\u2019s convictions or a commitment to better living. Rather, the\nnew birth is literally the impartation of Christ\u2019s divine nature where sinners,\ndead in their sins, are made new and alive in Christ. Therefore, \u201cHe who has\nthe Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life\u201d (1\nJohn 5:12; see also 2 Cor. 5:17; 2 Pet. 1:4). In the new birth, people receive\nfrom God His nature and His righteousness.\n2. The new birth is a cleansing: Titus states, \u201c\u2026according to His mercy\nHe saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy\nSpirit\u2026\u201d (Tit. 3:5). This suggests that in the new birth there is a cleansing of\nthe soul from the previous defilements of life.\n3. The new birth is a creation: Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026if anyone is in Christ, he is\na new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become\nnew\u201d (2 Cor. 5:17; see also Gal. 6:15; Eph. 2:10; 4:24). In Christ, humans\nbecome new creations. Salvation is more than a change or reformation in\nbehavior. Reformation is only an outward expression that cannot change the\nnature of the human heart. Jeremiah wrote that \u201cThe heart is deceitful above\nall things, And desperately wicked; Who can know it?\u201d (Jer. 17:9). In the\nnew birth, every individual becomes a new creation with a new nature and a\nnew heart.\n\n4. The new birth is a resurrection: All believers have been crucified with\nChrist and raised together with Him. In salvation, believers identify with\nChrist in His death, burial and resurrection. Concerning this reality Paul\nwrote the following:\nOr do you not know that as many of us as were bap-\ntized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?\nTherefore we were buried with Him through baptism\ninto death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead\nby the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk\nin newness of life. For if we have been united together\nin the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in\nthe likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our\nold man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin\nmight be done away with, that we should no longer be\nslaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from\nsin (Rom. 6:3-7).\nThe believer\u2019s death and resurrection in Christ is symbolized in the\nordinance of water baptism. Paul further pointed to this resurrected life in\nChrist when he wrote, \u201cBut God\u2026even when we were dead in trespasses,\nmade us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and\nraised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in\nChrist Jesus\u2026\u201d (Eph. 2:4-6). In the new birth, believers share in the resur-\nrected life of Jesus.\nB. The necessity of the new birth\n1. People cannot see the kingdom of God without a new birth. The new\nbirth is an absolute necessity (John 3:3). God does not prevent the unregen-\nerated from seeing His kingdom. Rather, it is impossible for the unregen-\nerated to see God\u2019s kingdom without the new birth. Scripture states, \u201cBut\nthe natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they\nare foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually\ndiscerned\u201d (1 Cor. 2:14). Spiritual discernment of God\u2019s kingdom can only\ncome through new birth.\n\n2. The nature of humankind\u2019s first birth requires a second birth. All\nhumans were born from parents with corrupted natures; therefore, every\nhuman is born with a corrupted nature. The psalmist wrote, \u201cBehold, I was\nbrought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me\u201d (Ps. 51:5).\nHuman effort cannot change the nature of humankind. Rather, every human\nborn of the flesh must also be born of the Spirit. Jesus made this clear to\nNicodemus: \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the\nSpirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh\nis flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\u201d (John 3:5-6). In Christ,\nbelievers are given a new nature because they are born again into the family\nof God through the power of the Holy Spirit.\n3. People are dead without the new birth. All who have not been born\nagain are \u201cdead in trespasses and sins\u201d (Eph. 2:1). They are devoid of spiritual\nlife and in need of a new birth. Arthur W. Pink summarized this clearly: \u201cLet\nus realize that the sinner is not ignorant, needing instruction; he is not weak\nand in need of invigoration; he is not sick and in need of doctoring. He is\ndead and needs to be made alive.\u201d14 When Jesus said, \u201c\u2026unless one is born\nagain, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d (John 3:3), He was not stating a\ntheological dogma or issuing a divine edict. Instead, Jesus was stating the sim-\nple fact that all humans are dead and unable to experience the life of Christ\noutside of being born again.\nC. How the new birth occurs\nEternal life is the gift of God (John 1:13). Humans cannot save them-\nselves, nor earn the position of divine sonship. No human work or effort can\nbring a person to life in Christ. Paul wrote, \u201cFor by grace you have been saved\nthrough faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works,\nlest anyone should boast\u201d (Eph. 2:8-9; see also Tit. 3:5). While the new birth\nis the gift of God, there are certain divine and human aspects involved in\nthe experience.\n14 Arthur W. Pink. Exposition of the Gospel of John (Three Volumes Complete and Unabridged in One). (Grand\nRapids, MI: Zondervan, 1968) 103-119.\n\n1. The divine side: The Holy Spirit and the word of God are the agents\nby which all creation came into existence (Gen. 1). Likewise, the new birth\nis brought about through the word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit.\na) The Holy Spirit is the agent of the new birth. Jesus said that\nhumans must be \u201cborn of the Spirit\u201d to \u201center the kingdom of God\u201d\n(John 3:5). The Holy Spirit brings the life of God into the heart of every\nbeliever. The Holy Spirit enables believers to partake of the divine nature.\nLife comes through the agency of the Spirit. Paul wrote, \u201cBut if the Spirit\nof Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised\nChrist from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His\nSpirit who dwells in you\u201d (Rom. 8:11).\nb) The word of God is vital to the new birth. Indeed, the Holy Spirit\nbears witness to the word in bringing the new birth to pass. James artic-\nulated the role of the word of God in new birth: \u201cOf His own will He\nbrought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-\nfruits of His creatures\u201d (Jas. 1:18). Peter wrote that believers are \u201c\u2026born\nagain, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of\nGod which lives and abides forever\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 1:23).\n2. The human side: While humans cannot regenerate themselves, to\nreceive the new birth, they still must believe the message of the gospel and\naccept Jesus Christ as their Savior.\na) Humans receive the new birth through believing the message of\nthe gospel, that the work of Christ on the cross is sufficient for salva-\ntion. \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\nthat whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d\n(John 3:16).\nb) Humans enter into the new birth through accepting Jesus Christ\nas their Savior. Salvation is an intensely personal experience that occurs\nwhen individuals place their complete faith and trust in Jesus. Individuals\n\ncome alive in Christ when they receive Jesus as their Savior. Through\nfaith in Jesus, believers become children of God. \u201cBut as many as received\nHim, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who\nbelieve in His name\u201d (John 1:12; see also Gal. 3:26).\nD. The results of the new birth\n1. In the new birth individuals become children of God. As children of\nGod, believers immediately become heirs of God with access to the resources\nof the heavenly Father. \u201cThe Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that\nwe are children of God, and if children, then heirs\u2014heirs of God and joint\nheirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified\ntogether\u201d (Rom. 8:16-17).\n2. In the new birth individuals become new creations and partakers of\nthe divine nature (2 Cor. 5:17; 2 Pet. 1:4). Consequently, the nature and\nattitude of the believer are transformed. In Christ, believers have a deep love\nfor each other: \u201cWe know that we have passed from death to life, because we\nlove the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death\u201d (1 John\n3:14). As new creations, believers develop a new and deeper love of God\nand God\u2019s word: \u201cWe love Him because He first loved us\u201d (1 John 4:19; see\nalso 1 Pet. 2:2). As partakers of God\u2019s divine nature, believers also display a\nprofound love for their enemies: \u201cBut I say to you, love your enemies, bless\nthose who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who\nspitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in\nheaven\u2026\u201d (Matt. 5:44-45).\n3. The new birth enables believers to live a life of victory over sin and\nthe corruption of the world. John stated that individuals in Christ will not\ncontinue to live a lifestyle of sin: \u201cThose who are God\u2019s children do not con-\ntinue sinning, because the new life from God remains in them. They are not\nable to go on sinning, because they have become children of God\u201d (1 John\n3:9, NCV).\n\nVIII. Salvation and Adoption\nThe Scripture speaks of salvation as an adoption. The word \u201cadoption\u201d\nappears exclusively in Paul\u2019s epistles and is used five different times. The term\nis applied once to Israel as a nation: \u201c\u2026who are Israelites, to whom pertain\nthe adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of\nGod, and the promises\u2026\u201d (Rom. 9:4). It is also used to refer to the full\nredemption of the believer\u2019s body at the second coming of the Lord: \u201c\u2026even\nwe ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the\nredemption of our body\u201d (Rom. 8:23). The other three references speak of\nadoption as a present fact in the life of Christians: \u201cBut when the fullness of\nthe time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under\nthe law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the\nadoption as sons\u201d (Gal. 4:4-5; see also Rom. 8:15; Eph. 1:5). Paul used the\nword adoption to describe not only the condition of believers but also their\npositional authority.\n1. Biblical usage of adoption: Applied to believers, adoption literally\nmeans \u201cplacing as a son.\u201d After becoming a child of God through the new\nbirth, a believer is immediately considered an adult son through adoption.\nThere is no childhood period in the sphere of Christian standing and respon-\nsibility. Consequently, adoption does not just mean son-making, but son-\nplacing. Adoption takes place the moment a person is born into the family\nof God and is simultaneous with regeneration and justification. In the eter-\nnal counsel of God, adoption took place when \u201cHe [God] chose us in Him\n[Christ] before the foundation of the world\u201d (Eph. 1:4-5). However, the full\nrealization and enjoyment of adoption will be when the Lord returns for His\nown (Rom. 8:23).\n2. The results of adoption\na) The witness of the Holy Spirit: Paul wrote that God redeemed \u201c\u2026\nthose who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.\nAnd because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into\nyour hearts, crying out, \u2018Abba, Father!\u2019\u201d (Gal. 4:5-6). The Holy Spirit\n\ntestifies to the sonship of all believers: \u201cThe Spirit Himself bears witness\nwith our spirit that we are children of God\u201d (Rom. 8:16). The Holy\nSpirit assures us that believers are not only adopted, but that they can\nhave personal fellowship with their heavenly Father: \u201c\u2026but you received\nthe Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u2018Abba, Father\u2019\u201d (Rom. 8:15).\nb) Divine acceptance: \u201cFor you did not receive the spirit of bondage\nagain to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption\u2026\u201d (Rom. 8:15).\nThrough the indwelling Holy Spirit, believers are assured of a relation-\nship with God based on love rather than fear.\nc) Made joint heirs with Christ: \u201cAnd if [we are] children, then [we\nare] heirs\u2014heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer\nwith Him, that we may also be glorified together\u201d (Rom. 8:17). Through\nadoption in Christ, a believer receives the full inheritance of an adult son:\nNow I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not\ndiffer at all from a slave, though he is master of all, but is\nunder guardians and stewards until the time appointed\nby the father. Even so we, when we were children, were\nin bondage under the elements of the world. But when\nthe fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His\nSon, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem\nthose who were under the law, that we might receive the\nadoption as sons\u2026Therefore you are no longer a slave\nbut a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through\nChrist (Gal. 4:1-7).\nd) Men and women receive sonship: \u201cFor you are all sons of God\nthrough faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into\nChrist have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is nei-\nther slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one\nin Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal. 3:26-28). The Foursquare church\u2019s Women in\nLeadership Ministry explains this role of adoption well:\n\nFaith in Christ brings us into an entirely new rela-\ntionship with God. He becomes our Father, not in\na metaphorical sense, but in a literal sense. By being\njoined spiritually to His only begotten Son, we become\nadopted sons; this position of \u201csonship\u201d applies to both\nmen and women. \u201cIn Christ\u201d women stand before God\n(along with men) as \u201csons\u201d (Gal. 3:26; 4:6-7). This term\nis not intended to disparage the position of a daugh-\nter but to emphasize the point that women are not\nascribed a lesser status than men. Women are \u201csons\u201d in\nthis case because they are joined to the Son. They stand\non exactly the same level as men, they inherit exactly\nthe same promises, and they can have exactly the same\ntypes of ministry.15\nMany redeemed children of the Lord do not realize their inheritance.\nMany approach God only as servants and fail to approach God also as dearly\nloved sons. As in the story of the prodigal son, many believers live like the son\nwho stayed home with his father yet resented the love and attention his way-\nward brother received. In serving his father, the son had failed to realize the\ntruth of his father\u2019s words, \u201cSon, you are always with me, and all that I have is\nyours\u201d (Luke 15:31). Through adoption, believers are able to draw upon their\nfull inheritance as heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.\nIX. Salvation and the Process of Sanctification\nThe doctrine of sanctification is closely related to Christian daily living.\nTherefore, it is extremely important for believers to understand the practical\nimplications of sanctification from a biblical perspective. A clear understand-\ning of sanctification will empower the believer to enter into the full benefits\nof salvation.\n15 Women in Ministry Leadership: A Summary of the Biblical Position of the Foursquare Church Concerning\nGod\u2019s Grace and a Woman\u2019s Potential Under His Sovereignty and Call (Foursquare Media, 2021) 32.\n\nA. The meaning of sanctification\nIn Scripture, sanctification has a primary and secondary meaning. It is\nimportant that individuals understand these meanings in their proper order.\nFor many, \u201ccleansing\u201d is the first word that comes to mind when dealing with\nthe definition of sanctification; even so, that is not its primary meaning.\n1. The primary meaning of sanctification is the process of dedicating,\nconsecrating or setting apart someone or something for a specific and holy\npurpose. In the Old Testament, many inanimate things were sanctified, such\nas a house (Lev. 27:14), a field (Lev. 27:16) or the vessels of the temple (2\nChron. 29:19). In addition to inanimate objects, the firstborn of Israel were\nsanctified or set apart for the Lord. \u201cConsecrate to Me all the firstborn, what-\never opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast; it\nis Mine\u201d (Exod. 13:2). This concept of sanctification is not a moral cleansing\nbut a setting apart for the Lord. In the same manner, Christians are sanctified\nor set apart for the glory of God. Even the Greek word for \u201cchurch,\u201d ekklesia,\nmeans \u201cthe called out ones.\u201d Consequently, each member of the church is set\napart or sanctified to bring glory to God.\n2. The secondary meaning of sanctification is the progressive process of\ncleansing and purging someone from moral defilement. Unlike justification,\nwhich is a onetime experience, sanctification is both an event and a process.\nThe cleansing process of sanctification has three distinct phases or aspects.\nB. Aspects of sanctification\n1. Positional sanctification: The moment people are born again they\nare sanctified. Paul wrote, \u201cBut you were washed, but you were sanctified,\nbut you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of\nour God\u201d (1 Cor. 6:11; see also 2 Thess. 2:13; Heb. 10:10; 13:12). This is a\npositional sanctification where the holiness of Jesus is imputed to all believ-\ners. They might not be perfect in their daily living, but the holiness of Jesus\nis put to their account. Paul wrote that Christ Jesus, \u201c\u2026 became for us wis-\ndom from God\u2014and righteousness and sanctification and redemption \u2026\u201d\n\n(1 Cor. 1:30). In other words, Christ\u2019s sanctification becomes the sanctifi-\ncation for all who believe in Him.\nThe Bible\u2019s use of words such as saint, holy and blameless demonstrates\nthe concept of positional sanctification. Believers are referred to as \u201csaints\u201d\nthroughout the epistles (1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1; Jude 3). When writing to the\nCorinthian church, Paul not only called believers saints, but he also declared\nthat they were blameless and holy in the eyes of God. Even so, Paul\u2019s instruc-\ntions to the Corinthian church reveal that the believers were far from perfect\nin their daily living. In fact, they were accused of being carnal and guilty\nof numerous sins. Although the Corinthian believers were positionally holy,\nhaving the holiness of Christ imputed to them, they still frequently failed to\nmanifest Christ\u2019s holiness in their practical living.\n2. Practical sanctification: Paul spoke of the Christians at Thessalonica\nas being \u201csanctified\u201d (2 Thess. 2:13), but he also prayed for their sanctifica-\ntion (1 Thess. 5:23). He recognized that they were sanctified positionally but\nneeded holiness to become progressively part of their daily Christian living.\nIn this manner, sanctification is a continuing process throughout a Christian\u2019s\nentire lifetime. Sanctification is not the absence of bad behavior. People are\nnot considered holy because of the things they do not do. Rather, sanctifica-\ntion is the positive activity of being conformed to the image of Christ. This\ngradual growth occurs as believers daily surrender their lives to be conformed\nto the image of God through the power of the Holy Spirit and the grace of\nGod (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Pet. 3:18).\nProgressive sanctification occurs as believers identify with Christ and\nconsider themselves dead to sin. \u201cLikewise you also, reckon yourselves to be\ndead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Rom. 6:11).\nAll believers have died to sin because of Christ\u2019s sacrifice, but all have not yet\nfully claimed the riches provided for them through Christ\u2019s death. Believers\nare not asked to die experientially; they are urged only to \u201creckon\u201d themselves\nto be dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. As new creations, alive in\nChrist, believers are conformed to the image of Christ as they walk \u201caccording\nto the Spirit\u201d that abides within them (Rom. 8:1-11). As believers live accord-\ning to the Spirit, they \u201cput to death the deeds of the body\u201d (Rom. 8:13). As\n\nbelievers die to themselves and yield their will to the transformational work\nof the Holy Spirit, they experience progressive sanctification.\nIt is important to note that the Bible does not say that in this life\nChristians will reach a place where they no longer sin. In fact, John wrote,\n\u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not\nin us\u201d (1 John 1:8). Although Paul admonished the church to advance in\n\u201cperfecting holiness\u201d and Jesus commanded us to \u201cbe perfect, just as your\nFather in heaven is perfect,\u201d these scriptures seem to refer to moving toward\ncompleteness or maturity, not sinless perfection (Matt. 5:48; 2 Cor. 7:1).\nSome have been confused in this regard because of 1 John 3:9: \u201cWhoever\nhas been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he\ncannot sin, because he has been born of God.\u201d However, it is important to\nnote that all of the verbs in this passage are in the present tense. Therefore,\nJohn is literally saying that God\u2019s children do not \u201cpractice\u201d sin; it is not the\npattern of their lives.\nPaul seemingly referred to the process of progressive sanctification in\nhis explanation that spiritual leadership is \u201cfor the equipping of the saints\nfor the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all\ncome to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to\na perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 4:12-13). In sanctification, Christians acknowledge and surrender to\nthe truth that they have died in Christ and are now \u201chidden with Christ\nin God\u201d (Col. 3:3). From this perspective, believers grow in holy living as\nthey allow the work of the cross to transform their daily living through the\npower of the Holy Spirit. \u201cI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer\nI who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh\nI live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\u201d\n(Gal. 2:20). Christians who surrender to the transformational work of the\nHoly Spirit will perpetually grow in expressing the holiness and character\nof God.\n3. Complete and final sanctification: The complete expressed sanctifi-\ncation of all believers awaits the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus and the\n\nresurrection of all who believe. \u201cFor our citizenship is in heaven, from which\nwe also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform\nour lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to\nthe working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself\u201d (Phil.\n3:20-21). Resurrected believers will experience sinless perfection: \u201cAnd God\nwill wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor\nsorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have\npassed away\u201d (Rev. 21:4). Through faith in Jesus Christ, individuals are saved\nfrom the penalty of sin; through yielding to the work of the Holy Spirit,\nbelievers are set free from the power of sin; through their bodily resurrection,\nbelievers are set free from the presence of sin. Until that final consummation,\n\u201c\u2026we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,\nare being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the\nSpirit of the Lord\u201d (2 Cor. 3:18).\nC. Means of sanctification\nAs with many other aspects of the Christian experience, there is both a\ndivine and human side to the means of sanctification.\n1. Divine side\na) The Father: Jesus prayed to the Father concerning His disciples:\n\u201cSanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). Paul\nacknowledged the sanctifying work of the Father when he prayed, \u201cNow\nmay the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your\nwhole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our\nLord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it\u201d (1\nThess. 5:23-24). The perfection of the believer is the work of the Father:\n\u201cNow may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the\ndead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the ever-\nlasting covenant, make you complete in every good work to do His will,\nworking in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ,\nto whom be glory forever and ever. Amen\u201d (Heb. 13:20-21).\n\nb) The Son: Jesus has sanctified believers through the sacrifice of His\nown body and by the shedding of His own precious blood (Heb. 10:10;\n13:12). \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church\nand gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the\nwashing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a\nglorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that\nshe should be holy and without blemish\u201d (Eph. 5:25-27).\nc) The Holy Spirit: The indwelling power and anointing of the Holy\nSpirit provides believers victory over the sins of the flesh. \u201cFor if you live\naccording to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death\nthe deeds of the body, you will live\u201d (Rom. 8:13). In Galatians 5, Paul\ncontrasted the works of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit. The works\nof the flesh are evident, such as \u201cadultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewd-\nness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath,\nselfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, rev-\nelries, and the like\u2026\u201d (Gal. 5:19-21). In contrast, \u201c\u2026the fruit of the\nSpirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,\ngentleness, self-control\u201d (Gal. 5:22-23). Those who live according to the\nSpirit produce good fruit. When believers receives and walk in the full-\nness of the Holy Spirit, they receive the ability to overcome \u201cthe lust of\nthe flesh\u201d (Gal. 5:16). Through yielding to the sanctifying work of the\nHoly Spirit, believers \u201care being transformed into the same image from\nglory to glory\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 3:18).\n2. Human side: It is God who sanctifies believers. Humans cannot sanc-\ntify themselves, \u201c\u2026for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for\nHis good pleasure\u201d (Phil. 2:13). Even so, humans have the ability to partner\nwith or reject the sanctifying work of the gospel: \u201cTherefore, having these\npromises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and\nspirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God\u201d (2 Cor. 7:1). Although it is God\nwho cleanses, it is the responsibility of every believer to flee \u201cyouthful lusts\u201d\nand to \u201cpursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the\nLord out of a pure heart\u201d (2 Tim. 2:22). In yielding to the will of the Father\nthrough the power of the Holy Spirit, the believer becomes a \u201c\u2026vessel for\n\nhonor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work\u201d\n(2 Tim. 2:21). The following are some of the ways believers can yield to the\nsanctifying work of God.\na) By walking in faith: By faith in Jesus Christ believers are sanctified\nby His blood (Heb. 10:10; 13:12).\nb) By obeying God\u2019s Word: The Word of God is powerful and cleans-\ning when it is received, believed and obeyed by believers (John 15:3;\n17:17; Eph. 5:26; 1 John 1:7).\nc) By yielding to the Holy Spirit: As believers submit to the work of\nthe Holy Spirit, they are given the desire and power to obey God\u2019s word\n(John 16:13).\nd) By intentional personal commitment: Believers experience the\nsanctifying work of God when they separate themselves from worldly\npursuits and commit to pursuing God\u2019s perfect will for their lives. In this\ndeep, personal commitment, believers acknowledge that Jesus is not only\ntheir Savior but also their Lord. When believers surrender to the rule of\nGod and daily seek His holiness, they grow in the fruit of practical sanc-\ntification (Rom. 6:13, 19; 12:1-2).\nX. Salvation and Assurance\nIt is imperative that people have assurance of their salvation. Everything\nelse in the Christian life depends on this assurance. God\u2019s plan of salvation\nhas reestablished fellowship between Himself and humans. Part of the foun-\ndation of that fellowship is assurance. God wants believers to know they are\nsaved. If it is impossible for individuals to receive salvation after they die,\nthen it seems crucial that individuals should clearly know if and when they\nare saved.\n\nA. Elements of assurance\n1. The witness of the Spirit: When a person is born again, the Holy\nSpirit testifies within that person that a work of grace has occurred. \u201cThe\nSpirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God\u2026\u201d\n(Rom. 8:16; see also Gal. 4:6; 1 John 3:24). It is not easy to put into words\nhow this \u201cwitness\u201d is manifested, for it is a spiritual phenomenon. Regardless,\nat salvation, believers receive a Spirit-inspired assurance that they have been\nbrought into the family of God. The Holy Spirit witnesses to believers that\ntheir salvation is assured.\n2. The testimony of the Bible: Many portions of Scripture provide reas-\nsurance that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe (John\n3:36; 5:24; Rom. 10:9-10). John wrote, \u201cThese things I have written to you\nwho believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have\neternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of\nGod\u201d (1 John 5:13).\n3. Love for God\u2019s family: When believers love God\u2019s children, it is evi-\ndence that God has created a work of grace in their hearts. John wrote, \u201cWe\nknow that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.\nHe who does not love his brother abides in death. Whoever hates his brother\nis a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in\nhim\u201d (1 John 3:14-15). Just as Cain revealed his wickedness in the murder\nof his brother Abel, believers reveal their righteousness in loving one another.\n\u201cBeloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves\nis born of God and knows God\u201d (1 John 4:7).\n4. Desire to obey God\u2019s commands: A person can obey God only through\nbeing born again and by experiencing God\u2019s transforming grace (Rom. 8:7;\n1 John 2:3-5). Obedience requires the transformation of a person\u2019s nature.\nWhen individuals sincerely try to obey God\u2019s commandments, they demon-\nstrate that they love the Lord and have experienced God\u2019s transforming grace\n(John 14:21, 23; 1 John 2:5; 3:24).\n\n5. Transformation of the believer\u2019s life and desires: Paul wrote that \u201c\u2026\nif anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away;\nbehold, all things have become new\u201d (2 Cor. 5:17). This wondrous work of\nregeneration is expressed in the glorious transformation of the believer\u2019s life\nand desires. The following are some results of transformation.\na) A desire to repent: Saved people have an increased desire to turn\nfrom sin. When individuals experience the saving grace of Jesus, they\ngain an increased desire for the righteousness of God to reign in their\nlives. Consequently, saved people will eagerly repent of their sins.\nb) An abiding peace: Redeemed people experience a deep settled\npeace. This peace is rooted in the removal of sin and the establishment\nof communion with God. \u201cTherefore, having been justified by faith, we\nhave peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (Rom. 5:1).\nc) The fear of death removed: In salvation, the question of sin has\nbeen settled. Judgment and condemnation have passed. Those \u201c\u2026who\nthrough fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage\u201d are now\nfree to eagerly anticipate seeing their Savior (Heb. 2:15).\nB. Results of assurance\n1. Stability in life: Believers who have an assurance of their salvation\nwill remain stable during difficult times. They will live with the assurance\nthat God does not change, and therefore His grace is sufficient in all circum-\nstances and situations.\n2. An effective prayer life: Believers with an assurance of their salvation\nwill have an effective prayer life, knowing that they have communion with\nGod and can approach God with their concerns and requests.\n3. Authority over Satan: When believers are confident that they are \u201chid-\nden with Christ in God\u201d (Col. 3:3), they have power to resist Satan and to\n\nstand firm under satanic attacks. Assurance of a secure relationship with God\nwill enable believers to endure the struggles of living in a fallen world.\nXI. Salvation and the Security of the Believer\nDo believers have the ability to lose or abandon their salvation? To\nanswer this question we must look at the interplay between the sovereignty of\nGod and the free will of humans. Scripture teaches that God is sovereign, yet\nhumans are responsible for their free moral choices. Consequently, a healthy\nview of the security of the believer must hold these truths in tension. On one\nhand, it is crucial that believers have an assurance and security in their salva-\ntion. On the other hand, believers must be aware of their ability to abandon\nor reject their salvation. Every theological question ultimately has two sides\nbecause every doctrine deals with both God and people. When looking at the\nissue of the security of the believer, it is important to examine scriptures that\ndeal both with God\u2019s side and humanity\u2019s side. Some scriptures deal with the\npromises of God to sustain and protect the faith of each believer, while others\nhighlight the responsibility of humans to not depart from their faith. When\nviewed in their entirety, these scriptures demonstrate that believers can reject,\nabandon or walk away from their salvation.\nA. The promises of God\nNote these blessed promises of the keeping power of God for all who\nare saved:\n1. \u201cAnd I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall\nanyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me,\nis greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father\u2019s hand.\nI and My Father are one\u201d (John 10:28-30).\n2. \u201cFor I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor prin-\ncipalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor\n\ndepth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love\nof God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Rom. 8:38-39).\nB. The responsibility of humans\nAlthough Scripture speaks of the keeping power of God, it also points\nto the responsibility of the believer to accept and walk in the keeping power\nof God:\n1. \u201cFor it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have\ntasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and\nhave tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they\nfall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for\nthemselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame\u201d (Heb. 6:4-6). It\nseems clear that this passage describes a born again person. However, while\nthe passage warns of the danger of turning away from Christ, it must not\nbe used to teach emphatically that there is no hope for someone who falls\naway. Scripture teaches that God is \u201c\u2026long-suffering toward us, not willing\nthat any should perish but that all should come to repentance\u201d (2 Pet. 3:9).\nTherefore, we must at least allow for the possibility of forgiveness for individ-\nuals who humble themselves and return to Christ.\n2. \u201cBeware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief\nin departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is\ncalled \u2018Today,\u2019 lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.\nFor we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our\nconfidence steadfast to the end, while it is said: \u2018Today, if you will hear His\nvoice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion\u2019\u201d (Heb. 3:12-15). The\nwarning against \u201cdeparting from the living God\u201d and the admonition to hold\n\u201csteadfast to the end\u201d both seem to argue for the possibility that Christians\ncan choose to abandon or depart from their faith.\n3. \u201cFor if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the\ntruth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expec-\ntation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries\u201d\n(Heb. 10:26-27).\n\n4. \u201cBrethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone\nturns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his\nway will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins\u201d (Jas. 5:19-20).\nThis passage was written to Christians (see Jas. 1:2) and speaks of rescuing\nChristians whose sins are leading them to spiritual death.\nC. The relationship between God\u2019s sovereignty and human responsibility\nChristians are distinctly told to work out their salvation with \u201cfear and\ntrembling\u201d (Phil. 2:12). Even so, Scripture hastens to add, \u201c\u2026it is God who\nworks in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure\u201d (Phil. 2:13). It\ncertainly is not God\u2019s will that any of His children should be lost. It is also\ntrue that God is able to keep His children from falling. However, God does\nnot save people against their will, nor does He keep them against their will.\nJust as faith and repentance are necessary for salvation, so they are necessary\nfor the continuance of that salvation.\nThe scriptural condition for salvation is belief. John proclaimed, \u201cHe\nwho believes in the Son has everlasting life\u2026\u201d (John 3:36). Jesus said, \u201cHe\nwho believes in Him [Jesus] is not condemned; but he who does not believe\nis condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only\nbegotten Son of God\u201d (John 3:18; see also John 6:47). The word \u201cbelieve\u201d in\nthese passages is in the present progressive tense, which implies continuous\nfaith. In other words, Christians are commanded to believe and to continue\nto believe. The Bible does not promise that God will keep people from will-\nfully turning away from their salvation. In fact, the Scripture warns, \u201c\u2026if we\nsin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer\nremains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and\nfiery indignation which will devour the adversaries\u201d (Heb. 10:26-27). These\nverses clearly leave room for the possibility of Christians willfully turning\naway from Christ and rejecting their salvation.\nAlthough Scripture does recognize that believers can reject and break\ntheir union with Christ, this does not mean that Christians are kept secure\nin Christ purely by their own efforts. Christians are \u201c\u2026kept by the power of\nGod through faith for salvation\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 1:5). It is the part of the believer\n\nto believe in Him; it is the part of Him to keep the believer. The believer\u2019s\nresponsibility is to continually take advantage of the means of grace that God\nhas provided for His children. Christians cannot keep themselves, but they\ncan submit to the mighty keeping power of God within them. Christians\nwork out their salvation as God works within them (Phil. 2:12-13). The\nbeliever\u2019s part is to constantly feed on God\u2019s word, to yield to the ministering\npower of the Holy Spirit and to maintain unbroken fellowship with God\nthrough prayer. God is faithful to keep those who commit themselves to His\ncare. \u201c\u2026For I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able\nto keep what I have committed to Him until that Day\u201d (2 Tim. 1:12).\nNowhere in Scripture are we given license to presume against the power\nof God\u2019s grace. We have a high priest who can \u201csympathize with our weak-\nnesses\u201d (Heb. 4:15), and who \u201calways lives to make intercession for them\n[us]\u201d (Heb. 7:25). However, believers are also taught to \u201chold fast the profes-\nsion of our faith without wavering\u201d (Heb. 10:23). God does not take away\nhuman choice. Consequently, believers can turn away from the salvation that\nset them free. Even so, it is important to remember that God is able to help\nall who trust in Him. In Christ, believers have \u201c\u2026a merciful and faithful\nHigh Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of\nthe people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able\nto aid those who are tempted\u201d (Heb. 2:17-18). Those who continually trust\nand follow Jesus will never lose their salvation, for Christ will give them the\nstrength to overcome every trial and temptation. In salvation, believers can\nhave confidence \u201c\u2026that He who has begun a good work in you will complete\nit until the day of Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Phil. 1:6). Salvation is a grace gift, received\nby faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, sustained by loving communion\nwith God. Salvation is good news for all who believe.\n\n"};
