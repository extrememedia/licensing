var FOPT_CH10 = {"title": "The Doctrine of Last Things", "content": "531\nChapter Ten\nThe Doctrine of Last Things\nEschatology\nINTRODUCTION\nThe term \u201cEschatology\u201d comes from the Greek words eschatos meaning\n\u201clast\u201d and logos meaning \u201cidea, word, speech, discussion, reason or study.\u201d\nTherefore, Eschatology is the doctrinal study of the last events of sacred his-\ntory, including the final events of this present age as well as all that is beyond\nthis life and this age. Although this chapter will primarily focus on future\nevents, we will also address some of the present implications of living in the\neschatological age.\nI. The Eschatological Age\nThe life, death, resurrection and ascension of Christ ushered in the escha-\ntological age. The Old Testament prophets spoke of a future time or escha-\ntological age when Messiah would come and establish a new covenant and a\nnew way of abiding with God\u2019s people:\n\nBehold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will\nmake a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the\nhouse of Judah\u2026I will put My law in their minds, and write\nit on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be\nMy people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor,\nand every man his brother, saying, \u2018Know the LORD,\u2019 for\nthey all shall know Me, from the least of them to the great-\nest of them, says the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity,\nand their sin I will remember no more (Jer. 31:31-34).\nHebrews begins by acknowledging that Christ ushered in the last days:\n\u201cGod, who at various times and in various ways spoke in times past to the\nfathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son\u2026\u201d\n(Heb. 1:1-2). On the day of Pentecost, Peter announced that the church\nreceived the promise of the Holy Spirit as a fulfillment of Joel\u2019s prophecy:\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out\nof My Spirit on all flesh\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:17; see also Acts 2:16-21; Joel 2:28-32).\nPeter understood that Spirit-filled believers and a Spirit-filled church are both\nexpressions of God\u2019s work in the last days. Consequently, in this present day\nor last days, the church already enjoys certain aspects of the kingdom of God\nand \u201c\u2026the powers of the age to come\u2026\u201d (Heb. 6:5; see also Luke 17:21;\nMatt. 16:19).\nPentecostal believers should take great confidence in recognizing that the\nbaptism with the Holy Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy con-\ncerning the victorious work of God in the last days. Scripture states that there\nwill be spiritual battles in the last days: \u201cLittle children, it is the last hour; and\nas you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists\nhave come, by which we know that it is the last hour\u201d (1 John 2:18). Even so,\nSpirit-filled believers can confidently face the challenges of this age knowing\nthey have been empowered to faithfully minister the gospel as they eagerly\nanticipate the ultimate eschatological fulfillment of the coming of the Lord\n(Rom. 8:23; 1 Cor. 1:7; Luke 12:35-36; 1 Thess. 1:10). Recognizing that this\nis the \u201ceschatological\u201d age we will now look at two aspects of our current age:\nthe present state of the dead and the latter time signs of the Lord\u2019s coming.\n\nII. Death\nThe Scripture speaks of three kinds of death: physical death, spiritual\ndeath and the second or eternal death.\nA. Physical death\nPhysical death is the separation of the spirit from the body and constitutes\nthe transition from the visible world to the invisible. For believers, physical\ndeath marks their entrance into Paradise and into the presence of Christ Jesus\n(2 Cor. 5:1-8; Phil. 1:23). For unbelievers, physical death is their entrance\ninto Hades (Luke 16:22-23; Matt. 10:28; Rev. 20:13). Physical death is not\nthe end of existence but only a change in the state of existence. Physical death\nis the ultimate effect of sin on the human body and the last effect of sin on\nthe human body to be canceled by Christ\u2019s redeeming work (Rom. 5:12-15; 1\nCor. 15:26). Although all humans die physically, the atoning death and resur-\nrection of Christ has robbed death of its sting for believers (1 Cor. 15:54-57;\n2 Tim. 1:10; Heb. 2:9, 14-15; 9:15). In fact, Christians can triumphantly\ndeclare, \u201c\u2026to live is Christ, and to die is gain\u201d (Phil. 1:21).\nB. Spiritual death\nSpiritual death is separation from God both in this world and in the\nworld to come. For example, Adam and Eve \u201cdied\u201d as a result of their disobe-\ndience in accordance with the warning of God: \u201c\u2026for in the day that you\neat of it you shall surely die\u201d (Gen 2:17). Adam and Eve did not immediately\nphysically die when they disobeyed God. Though they became mortal, their\ndeaths (represented by exclusion from the garden) were first, spiritual deaths.\nWhen Jesus said, \u201c\u2026let the dead bury their own dead\u201d (Matt. 8:22), He\nmeant \u201clet the spiritually dead bury the physically dead.\u201d In these words Jesus\ndemonstrated that the spiritual death of unbelief is even worse than physi-\ncal death.\nPaul wrote to the Ephesians, \u201cAnd you He made alive, who were dead in\ntrespasses and sins\u2026\u201d (Eph. 2:1). As sinners, they existed in spiritual \u201cdeath\u201d;\n\nwhen they came to Christ, they were made alive. When individuals come into\nfellowship with God through faith in Christ, they pass from \u201cdeath to life\u201d\n(1 John 3:14). At the final \u201cGreat White Throne Judgment\u201d of unbelievers,\nwhich takes place after the thousand years (millennium), the wicked dead will\nstill exist and stand before God in judgment. Although they will be able to\nstand judgment, their state is called \u201cdeath\u201d because they are alienated from\nGod (Rev. 20:13-15; see also Rev. 3:1; 1 Tim. 5:6).\nC. Eternal Death\nWhen those who are spiritually dead die physically without repenting\nof their sin and confessing faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, they enter into the\nstate of eternal death. James referred to this death and how it may be averted:\n\u201c\u2026let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will\nsave a soul from death\u2026\u201d (James 5:20). Eternal death is not cessation of\nexistence; it is an everlasting punishment. Paul warned of this eventuality in\n2 Thessalonians 1:7-9:\n\u2026the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty\nangels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do\nnot know God, and on those who do not obey the gos-\npel of our Lord Jesus Christ. These shall be punished with\neverlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and\nfrom the glory of His power\u2026\nAt the final \u201cGreat White Throne Judgment\u201d all the wicked dead\nwill be cast into the \u201clake of fire\u201d which is called the \u201csecond death\u201d (Rev.\n20:13-15). The eternal death is described in Scripture as \u201ceternal fire\u201d or\n\u201ceverlasting fire\u201d (Jude 7; Matt. 18:8, 25:41), \u201ceverlasting punishment\u201d\n(Matt. 25:46), \u201ceternal judgment\u201d (Heb. 6:2), \u201ceverlasting destruction\u201d (2\nThess. 1:9) and \u201ceternal condemnation\u201d (Mark 3:29). Both \u201ceverlasting\u201d\nand \u201ceternal\u201d are derived from the same Greek word aionios which means\n\u201cage-abiding, eternal and without end\u201d but signifies \u201cwithout beginning or\nend\u201d when applied to God.\n\nIII. The Intermediate State\nThe intermediate state is that state of the human spirit between physical\ndeath and the resurrection. For the believer, the resurrection will occur at\nChrist\u2019s coming: for the unbeliever, it will not occur until after the millen-\nnium at the final judgment.\nA. Terms for the destination of the dead\n1. Sheol and Hades\nIn the Old Testament, the Hebrew word sheol is used to describe the\ndestination of the dead. Depending upon the context, Sheol can refer to the\nunderworld, the place of the dead, the grave, the pit or even the depths of\nthe earth. Although the King James and New King James Version sometimes\ntranslate Sheol as hell, most modern translations leave the word as Sheol.\nIn the New Testament, the Greek word hades is used instead of sheol. The\nSeptuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament used during the time\nof Jesus, translated sheol with the Greek word hades. Depending upon the\ncontext, Hades can refer to the place of the dead, the grave or the place where\nunbelievers live in torment.\n2. Gehenna, \u201clake of fire\u201d\nGehenna is a Greek word that comes from the Hebrew Gehinnom, which\nliterally means \u201cValley of Hinnom.\u201d Gehenna is a figurative term, translated\nas hell because of the fires that burned refuse in the Valley of Hinnom near\nJerusalem. Gehenna is the \u201clake of fire\u201d where unbelievers face their final\neternal punishment (Mark 9:43; Rev. 20:14-15).\nB. Intermediate state of the wicked\nWhen unbelievers die they go at once to Hades, which is the abode of\nthe wicked dead (Luke 16:22-31). Since the wicked do not go to their final\nperdition until after the last judgment when they are cast into the lake of fire,\n\nthe word \u201chell\u201d should not be used to describe the present state of the wicked\ndead. No one is at present in hell, which is the lake of fire. The wicked dead are\nin Hades awaiting their resurrection and final judgment. Hades is still a place\nof suffering as is seen in the account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:23).\nC. Intermediate state of the righteous\nThe Old Testament proclaims that those who have faith in the promises\nof God will not be abandoned to the grave. The psalmist wrote: \u201cBut God\nwill redeem my soul from the power of the grave [Sheol], For He shall receive\nme\u201d (Ps. 49:15). Jesus taught in the story of the rich man and Lazarus that\nthe righteous are \u201ccarried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom\u201d (Luke 16:22-\n23). To be carried to Abraham\u2019s bosom is to be with Abraham and share with\nAbraham in the blessings he has received. When comforting the repentant\nthief on the cross, Jesus said, \u201c\u2026Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be\nwith Me in Paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43).\nWhen the righteous die, they go immediately to be in the presence of Christ\nJesus. Paul spoke of \u201c\u2026having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which\nis far better\u201d (Phil. 1:23). Paul expected that after death he would immediately\nbe in the Lord\u2019s presence: \u201cWe are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be\nabsent from the body and to be present with the Lord\u201d (2 Cor. 5:8). When\nLazarus died, Jesus said that he went immediately to \u201cAbraham\u2019s bosom\u201d where\nhe was conscious and \u201ccomforted.\u201d The rich man \u201cbeing in torments in Hades\u201d\nwanted Abraham to send Lazarus to witness to his living brothers, showing that\nboth the just and unjust dead are in a state of conscious activity. Perhaps no\nthought is more comforting to believers than to know that at death they will\ngo to be with Jesus. Paul spoke the following words of hope: \u201cFor God did not\nappoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who\ndied for us that\u2026we should live together with Him. Therefore comfort each\nother and edify one another\u201d (1 Thess. 5:9-11).\nD. Christ\u2019s death and His intermediate state\nScripture clearly teaches that Christ died for the sins of humanity.\nAbraham was saved by faith, and so is every believer (Eph. 2:8-9). Christ\u2019s\n\ndeath and resurrection provide all believers the forgiveness of their sins and\neternal life with God. Although many scriptures speak clearly of the atoning\nwork of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, few address what happened between\nthe time of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection. Some scholars, based on their\ninterpretation of Ephesians 4:8-10 and 1 Peter 3:19-20, believe Christ per-\nsonally descended into Sheol, \u201cinto the lower parts of the earth\u201d and \u201cled cap-\ntivity captive\u201d (Eph. 4:8-10). The Apostles\u2019 Creed and the Athanasian Creed\nboth use the phrase \u201cdescended into hell [Hades]\u201d to describe the activity of\nChrist after the crucifixion and before the resurrection. Many who follow this\ntheory also believe there were two places in Sheol separated by an impass-\nable gulf (Luke 16:22-31). They believe that when Jesus went to Sheol or\nHades, He did not go into the abode of the wicked but to the part known as\n\u201cAbraham\u2019s bosom.\u201d Jesus emptied Sheol of the righteous, taking them with\nHim to paradise.\nSome scholars argue that Abraham\u2019s bosom is not in Sheol or Hades and\nthat Scripture does not teach that Jesus descended into Sheol or Hades to\nrelease the righteous dead. For instance, when Jesus told the story of the\nbeggar named Lazarus being carried to Abraham\u2019s bosom, Jesus disclosed the\nlocation of the rich man but not the location of Abraham\u2019s bosom: \u201cAnd\nbeing in torments in Hades, he [the rich man] lifted up his eyes and saw\nAbraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom\u201d (Luke 16:23). The Scripture\ndoesn\u2019t clearly describe where Abraham\u2019s bosom is located. Proponents of\nthis theory believe Jesus was simply teaching that the righteous were with\nAbraham receiving the full promises that Abraham received by faith. Those\nwith this view interpret the verse \u201cFor You will not leave my soul in Hades,\nNor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption\u201d as referring to Hades as\nsimply the grave (Acts 2:27, 31).\nE. False views of the intermediate state\nThere are several widely held false views of the intermediate state of the\ndead. Some of these views have no scriptural basis; others are based upon\nincorrect interpretations of Scripture. Three popular, false views are purga-\ntory, soul sleeping and spiritism.\n\n1. Purgatory\nThe Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches teach that mem-\nbers who have lived imperfect lives must spend some time in purgatory for\ntheir sins and imperfections to be purged. Depending upon the seriousness\nof their offenses, the length of time spent in purgatory may last hours or\ncenturies terminated only by the last judgment. According to the Catholic\nChurch, time in purgatory may be shortened by gifts or services rendered to\nthe church or by prayers or masses sponsored by relatives. The doctrine of\npurgatory is not supported by Scripture. The doctrine is based upon a passage\ntaken from the Apocrypha, found in 2 Maccabees 12:41-46. The Apocryphal\nbooks are not part of the canon of Scripture. They are included in Catholic\nBibles perhaps because they support doctrines not supported by the canonical\nScriptures. Scripture does not mention purgatorial sufferings. Furthermore,\nthe concept of purgatory violates the foundational teachings of Scripture of\nthe sufficiency of the blood of Christ to cleanse all sin and salvation by grace\nthrough faith (Heb. 10:10-23; Eph. 2:8-10; Rom. 3:24-28; 5:1-2, 9-10; 8:1,\n31-39; 10:8-11; 1 John 2:1-2; 3:1-2).\n2. Soul sleeping\nSoul sleeping is the belief that after death the soul rests in an unconscious\nstate until the resurrection. This doctrine is held by Seventh Day Adventists,\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses and several smaller groups. Arguments for soul sleeping\nfrequently include that (1) the Bible often refers to death as sleep (1 Thess.\n4:13-14; John 11:11-14), (2) a belief that the soul cannot function apart from\nthe body and will not awaken until joined with the body at the resurrection\nand (3) a conviction that it would be inappropriate for the righteous to enjoy\nheavenly bliss, or the unrighteous to suffer torment until after the final judg-\nment (Heb. 9:27).\nThe arguments for soul sleeping stated above will be answered in the\nsame order:\na) The Bible uses the term \u201csleep\u201d to describe death in a figurative and euphe-\nmistic way to emphasize that the deceased person still lives. W.E. Vine explained:\n\nThe metaphorical use of the word \u201csleep\u201d is appropriate,\nbecause of the similarity in appearance of a sleeping body\nand a dead body; restfulness and peace normally charac-\nterize both. The object of the metaphor is to suggest that,\nas the sleeper does not cease to exist while his body sleeps,\nso the dead person continues to exist despite his absence\nfrom the region in which those who remain can commu-\nnicate with him.4\nFurthermore, Jesus\u2019 account of the state of the rich man and Lazarus\nimmediately after death demonstrates clearly that their souls were not sleeping\nin unconsciousness (Luke 16:22-31). Paul confirmed that believers are imme-\ndiately with Christ after death with his statement to the Philippians:\n\u201c\u2026having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better\u201d (Phil.\n1:23).\nb) Paul\u2019s treatise on death in 2 Corinthians argues that the spirit of a\nperson can function apart from his or her body:\nSo we are always confident, knowing that while we are at\nhome in the body we are absent from the Lord. For we walk\nby faith, not by sight. We are confident, yes, well pleased\nrather to be absent from the body and to be present with\nthe Lord. Therefore we make it our aim, whether present\nor absent, to be well pleasing to Him (2 Cor. 5:6-9).\nPaul stated that \u201cto be present with the Lord\u201d meant \u201cto be absent from\nthe body.\u201d Furthermore, Paul\u2019s \u201caim\u201d was \u201cto be well pleasing\u201d to the Lord,\nwhether in the body or absent from it. If being absent from the body meant\n\u201csoul sleep,\u201d why would he be concerned about being pleasing to the Lord\nafter death? A sleeper could hardly be unpleasing to God. Since Paul expected\nto be conscious after death, he expected to please the Lord by praising Him\n(Rev. 7:9-10; see also Heb. 12:23; Rev. 6:9-11; Eccles. 12:7).\n4 William Edwy Vine, Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words (New York: Fleming H. Revell Publishing\nCompany, 1958) 81.\n\nc) Answering the assumption that humans must await the final judgment\nbefore enjoying bliss or suffering punishment, Louis Berkhof remarked: \u201cThe\nday of judgment is not necessary to reach a decision respecting the reward\nor punishment of each man, but only for the solemn announcement of the\nsentence, and for the revelation of the justice of God in the presence of men\nand angels.\u201d5 Jesus said, \u201cHe who believes in Him is not judged; he who does\nnot believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name\nof the only begotten Son of God\u201d (John 3:18, NASB). There will be a believ-\ner\u2019s judgment concerning rewards for service but not concerning salvation.\nSalvation is based only on faith in Jesus (2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 3:12-15).\n3. Spiritism\nSpiritism teaches that the living may communicate with the dead and\nthe dead with the living usually through the agency of a \u201cmedium.\u201d There\nis no evidence in the Bible to suggest that there can be legitimate commu-\nnication, interaction or influence between the living and the dead. In fact,\nthe Scripture unequivocally forbids any attempt to have communication or\ninteraction with the dead (Lev. 19:31; 20:6, 27; Deut. 18:9-12; Isa.\n8:19-20; 1 Chron. 10:13-14). There are two main explanations for spiritist\nphenomena: (1) they are produced by deceptive manipulations or (2) they are\nproduced by \u201clying spirits\u201d (1 Kings 22:22-23; 1 Tim 4:1). In Acts 16, Paul\ndelivered a girl from a spirit of divination (python) by which she was able to\nbring great gain to her exploiters (Acts 16:16-19). Certainly, evil spirits have\nthe power to deceive people who consult mediums by imitating the voice or\nappearance of deceased loved ones.\nSeeking biblical support, spiritists often cite the case of the witch of\nEndor bringing up the spirit of Samuel (1 Sam. 28:7-20). However, that\ncase does not encourage spiritism, for Saul was punished with death for dis-\nobeying the Lord by consulting a familiar spirit (1 Chron. 10:13-14). Some\nscholars believe that Samuel actually appeared to Saul. However, if Samuel\nactually appeared to Saul, it was by a rare special permission of the Lord\nto pronounce judgment upon Saul for his disobedience. Moses and Elijah\n5 Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1941) 689.\n\nalso appeared on the Mount of Transfiguration but again, by a rare special\npermission to represent the Law and the Prophets and to confirm that Christ\nJesus was the goal of Old Testament law and prophecy. \u201cTwo men, Moses and\nElijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about\nhis departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem\u201d (Luke\n9:30-31, NIV). The Greek word for \u201cdeparture\u201d is exodon, our \u201cexodus.\u201d Just\nas Moses, by the exodus from Egypt, delivered Israel from bondage, so Christ,\nby the exodus of the cross and resurrection, delivered mankind from the\nbondage of sin. The appearance of Moses and Elijah was a token of Messianic\nfulfillment (Matt. 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8). The Bible does not encourage indi-\nviduals to consult with the dead. Christ is the \u201cLord both of the dead and the\nliving\u201d (Rom. 14:9). If He ever permits the dead to appear, it will be to signal\nsome strategic event of sacred history. When we need comfort or guidance,\nwe have the Word of God and the Spirit of God.\nIV. The Second Coming of Christ\nThe subject of the second coming of Christ is an important doctrine.\nThe Foursquare Declaration of Faith addresses the significance of the sec-\nond coming:\nWe believe that the second coming of Christ is personal\nand imminent; that He will descend from Heaven in\nthe clouds of glory\u2026and at this hour, which no man\nknows beforehand, the dead in Christ shall rise, then the\nredeemed that are alive and remain shall be caught up\ntogether with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the\nair, and that so shall they ever be with the Lord; that also\nseeing that a thousand years is as a day with the Lord, and\nthat no man knows the hour of His appearance, which we\nbelieve to be at hand, each day should be lived as though\nHe were expected to appear at even, yet that in obedience\nto His explicit command, \u201cOccupy till I come,\u201d the work\nof spreading the gospel, the sending forth of missionaries,\nand the general duties for upbuilding the church should\n\nbe carried on as diligently, and thoroughly, as though nei-\nther ours nor the next generation should live in the flesh\nto see that glorious day.6\nA. The importance of Christ\u2019s second coming\nThe Bible frequently references the second coming of Christ, demon-\nstrating that the subject is of primary importance. Christ\u2019s second coming\nis mentioned more than 300 times in the New Testament. In Paul\u2019s epistles\nthere are more than 50 references to the second coming. The second coming\nis a primary theme in many books and chapters of the Bible. Jesus often\nreferred to His second coming and urged His followers to watch and to be\nready. New Testament believers are repeatedly urged to be ready for the Lord\nto come again. Several New Testament passages admonish believers to wait\nfor the coming of the Lord: \u201c\u2026wait for His Son from heaven, whom He\n[God] raised from the dead\u2026\u201d (1 Thess. 1:10; see also Rom. 8:23-25; 1 Cor.\n1:7; Gal. 5:5; James 5:7-8). Jesus connected the hope of His second coming\nwith the two ordinances of the church: baptism and communion. The apos-\ntles were commanded to \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations,\nbaptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy\nSpirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and\nlo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age\u201d (Matt. 28:19-20). Paul\nquoted Jesus, giving the apostolic pattern for the observance of the Lord\u2019s\nSupper: \u201cFor as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim\nthe Lord\u2019s death till He comes\u201d (1 Cor. 11:26; see also Matt. 26:26-29; Luke\n22:17-20).\nThe hope of the second coming provides believers with motivation for\npractical Christian living: (1) for brotherly love (1 Thess. 3:12-13), (2) for\nholiness (Rom. 13:12-14; 1 Thess. 3:13; 5:23; 1 John 3:3; Titus 2:11-13), (3)\nfor faithfully meeting together for worship (Heb. 10:25), (4) for faithfulness\nin Christian service (1 Tim. 4:13-16; 2 Tim. 4:1-2; 1 Pet. 5:2-4), (5) for a\ncontinued passion for souls (1 Thess. 1:9-10; 2:11-12, 19-20) and (6) for\n6Aimee Semple McPherson, Declaration of Faith (Los Angeles, CA: International Church of the Foursquare\nGospel, n.d.) 21-22.\n\ncomfort in times of bereavement (1 Thess. 4:14-18). The second coming is so\nimportant to the church, the bride of Christ, that the Bible refers to this event\nas the blessed hope: \u201c\u2026looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing\nof our great God and Savior Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Titus 2:13).\nB. The nature of Christ\u2019s second coming\nHow are we to understand the term \u201csecond coming?\u201d In what manner\nwill Christ come the second time? To answer these questions, we will look at\nwhat Scripture clearly teaches about Christ\u2019s second coming and also discuss\nseveral false explanations.\n1. The nature of Christ\u2019s second coming explained\na) The second coming of Christ is a literal coming or return. Since the\ncoming is a second one, it will be as literal as the first coming. There is no\nevidence in Scripture that Christ\u2019s return, which He promised, would be a\nfigurative one. The Old Testament has more references to Christ\u2019s second\ncoming than to His first. Prophecies of Christ\u2019s first coming were fulfilled lit-\nerally; therefore, there is no doubt that the prophecies concerning His second\ncoming will also be fulfilled literally.\nb) The Lord\u2019s second coming will be a personal return. \u201cI go to prepare\na place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again\nand receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also\u201d (John\n14:2-3). Christ\u2019s coming cannot be a figurative reference to some other being\nor to some spiritual experience of the believer because the angels said to the\ndisciples when Christ ascended to Heaven, \u201cThis same Jesus, who was taken\nup from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into\nheaven\u201d (Acts 1:11).\nc) The Lord\u2019s coming will be a visible, bodily second coming. At Christ\u2019s\nascension, the angel said that Christ would return \u201c\u2026in like manner as you\nsaw Him go into heaven\u201d (Acts 1:11). The disciples saw Him ascend in a\nglorified yet visible and tangible body. Christ will return in the same manner:\n\u201cBehold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him\u2026\u201d (Rev. 1:7).\n\n2. False explanations of the nature of Christ\u2019s second coming\na) The second coming is not the death of the believer. Christ\u2019s coming is\nat our resurrection, not at our death (1 Thess. 4:16-17). Death is the believer\u2019s\ndeparture to be with Christ, not Christ\u2019s coming for the believer (Phil. 1:23).\nChrist\u2019s coming is the defeat of death, not the occurrence of death (1 Cor. 15:51-\n54). Death is an enemy (1 Cor. 15:26); the Lord\u2019s coming is our blessed hope\n(Titus 2:13).\nb) Christ\u2019s second coming is not the coming of the Holy Spirit on the\nday of Pentecost. Jesus promised to send another \u201cHelper\u201d (John 14:16);\ntherefore, Jesus\u2019 coming and the Helper\u2019s coming could not be identical.\nFurthermore, most references to Christ\u2019s coming were written after Pentecost\nand indicate a future event (Acts 3:19-21). None of the phenomena proph-\nesied to accompany Christ\u2019s Parousia (His second coming) happened on the\nday of Pentecost.\nc) Christ\u2019s second coming was not the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D.\n70. The destruction of Jerusalem by Titus may have been referred to as a\ntype of latter day event during the tribulation, but the Lord did not come\nand catch up His church simultaneously with this event (see Matt. 24:15-\n23; Luke 21:24-28). Titus\u2019 destruction of Jerusalem scattered Israel; Christ\u2019s\ncoming will mark the gathering of Israel (Joel 3:16-18).\nd) Christ\u2019s second coming is not conversion. If Christ\u2019s second coming\nwas at conversion, His coming would not be a second one but one of millions\nof comings. Scripture states \u201c\u2026Christ was offered once to bear the sins of\nmany. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart\nfrom sin, for salvation\u201d (Heb. 9:28). According to Paul, the believer waits for\nthe Lord\u2019s coming after conversion, not before it (1 Thess. 1:9-10).\nC. The time of Christ\u2019s second coming\nJesus said regarding the time of His return, \u201cBut of that day and hour no\none knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only\u201d (Matt. 24:36).\nSome scholars contend that Jesus and His disciples expected His coming to\n\nbe within the first generation after His ascension. However, in the parable of\nthe talents Jesus said, \u201cAfter a long time the lord of those servants came\u2026\u201d\n(Matt. 25:19). Since the parable was about the coming of the kingdom, the\nterm \u201clong time\u201d seems to hint of a considerable delay in the coming. Peter\ncould not have expected an immediate coming for he said:\n\u2026knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last\ndays\u2026saying, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For\nsince the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they\nwere from the beginning of creation.\u201d\u2026But, beloved, do\nnot forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as\na thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The\nLord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count\nslackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that\nany should perish but that all should come to repentance\n(2 Pet. 3:3-9).\nJesus also said, \u201cAnd this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all\nthe world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come\u201d (Matt.\n24:14). When the Thessalonian church became upset by the belief that the\ngreat tribulation had already begun, Paul exhorted them \u201cnot to be soon\nshaken in mind or troubled\u2026for that Day will not come unless the fall-\ning away comes first\u2026\u201d (2 Thess. 2:1-3). On the other hand, Jesus warned,\n\u201cWatch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming\u201d\n(Matt. 24:42). Even though there were clear indications that the Lord\u2019s return\nwould not occur until after an extended period of evangelization, the church\nwas taught to be ready for an any-moment appearance of the heavenly bride-\ngroom (Matt. 24:44, 48, 50; 25:13; Mark 13:35-37; Titus 2:12-13; John\n3:3). The apostle Peter, who sat at the feet of Jesus, strongly urged the recip-\nients of his second epistle to look for Christ\u2019s return: \u201cTherefore, since all\nthese things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in\nholy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day\nof God\u201d (2 Pet. 3:11-12). Peter adds the thought that we may actually hasten\nthe coming day. The church certainly is not to sit by passively waiting for a\nset day that will end this dispensation. The church is working together with\nthe Lord to accomplish His work which must be done before He returns in\n\nglory. Michael Green commented on how believers should respond to these\nverses from 2 Peter:\nChristians are expected to look for the coming of the Lord;\nhad not Jesus Himself told them to watch? But this does\nnot mean pious inactivity. It means action. For wonderful\nas it may seem, we can actually \u201chasten it on\u201d (NEB) (not\n\u201chasting unto\u201d as in AV). In other words, the timing of the\nadvent is to some extent dependent upon the state of the\nchurch and of society. What a wonderfully positive con-\nception of the significance of our time on earth. It is no\nbarren waiting for \u201cfinis\u201d to be written. It is intended to be\na time of active cooperation with God in the redemption\nof society\u20267\nIs it possible that God sees time in the terms of tasks accomplished rather\nthan earthly calendars? In any case, looking for the Lord does not mean fold-\ning our arms but rather putting our hands to the plow and to the sickle.\nD. The signs of His second coming\nWhile no one knows the time of Christ\u2019s second coming, the Bible\nexplains there are signs that will accompany Christ\u2019s return. Jesus revealed\na number of signs concerning coming events when answering the questions\nof His disciples (Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21). Some of the events Jesus\ndescribed happened in the first century; some have come progressively up to\nthe present age; others will happen just before and during His second coming\nin power and glory. The time sequence of the \u201csign events\u201d for Christ\u2019s sec-\nond coming is revealed in Christ\u2019s Olivet discourse recorded in all three syn-\noptic gospels. In the epistles a number of passages describe prevailing latter\ndays conditions (1 Tim. 4:1-3; 2 Tim. 3:1-7; 1 Thess. 5:1-3; 2 Thess. 2:1-12;\nJames 5:1-8; 2 Pet. 3:1-10). Latter day signs are of two kinds: primary signs\nand secondary signs. Primary signs are those that the Bible declares explic-\nitly to be evidences of the near approach of the day of the Lord. Secondary\n7Michael Green, The Second Epistle General of Peter and the General Epistle of Jude: An Introduction and a Com-\nmentary (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1976) 140.\n\nsigns are inferential; that is, they are events or conditions that would have to\nprecede the explicitly stated biblical signs in order for them to happen. For\ninstance, Revelation states that the beast out of the earth (the Antichrist) will\ncause everyone to receive a \u201cmark\u201d or \u201cnumber\u201d without which no one can\nbuy or sell. In order for the Antichrist to exercise such control over humanity,\nsome believe there will need to exist a mechanism by which total control can\nbe expedited. With half the world\u2019s peoples ruled by totalitarian governments\nand with most of society subject to \u201cnumber\u201d identification and comput-\nerized records of financial transactions, the environment now exists for the\nbeast\u2019s appearance. Although every generation has had the potential to serve\nthe spirit of the Antichrist, many students of prophecy view modern develop-\nments, scientific advancements, military capabilities and international align-\nments as legitimate last day indicators. The following are some of the world\nconditions prophetic scholars highlight as signs of the latter days.\n1. The regathering of Israel in Palestine\nAs far back as the time of Moses, God proclaimed that Israel, if disobe-\ndient, would be scattered throughout all the nations (Deut. 28:64). God also\ndeclared that He would regather His people out of all the nations, bring-\ning them back into their land (Deut. 30:3; Isa. 11:11-16; Ezek. 36:8-24;\n37:11-12; 38:8). In the Old Testament, there are prophecies concerning\ntwo regatherings. Israel would be regathered from Babylonia after seventy\nyears of captivity (Jer. 25:11-12), but in this first captivity they were not\nscattered throughout all the nations, and their return was not complete or\npermanent. The Deuteronomy, Isaiah and Ezekiel passages cited above refer\nto a complete and permanent regathering of Israel ending in a rule of peace\nand righteousness. The second scattering of Israel into all nations is prophe-\nsied by Jesus: \u201cAnd they [Israel] will fall by the edge of the sword [A.D. 70]\nand be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled\nby Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled\u201d (Luke 21:24). The\nphrase \u201ctimes of the Gentiles\u201d refers to the period symbolized by the image\nseen by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream interpreted by Daniel (Dan. 2:24-45).\nThis is a period during which a succession of Gentile rulers dominate Europe\nand the Middle East, including Palestine. Daniel himself had a dream in\nwhich he saw these same Gentile rulers represented by four beasts, the last\n\nof which ruled \u201cuntil the Ancient of Days came\u2026and the time came for the\nsaints to possess the kingdom\u201d (Dan. 7:22). Paul seems to refer to the term\n\u201ctimes of the Gentiles\u201d in his letter to the Romans:\nFor I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant\nof this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opin-\nion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the\nfullness of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will\nbe saved, as it is written: \u201cThe Deliverer will come out of\nZion, And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; For\nthis is My covenant with them, When I take away their\nsins\u201d (Rom. 11:25-27).\nOn May 14, 1948, regathered Jews declared a portion of Palestine to be\nthe independent state of Israel. This act did not fulfill specifically the proph-\necies concerning Israel\u2019s regathering, for this regathering has been in unbelief.\nHowever, after nearly two thousand years of exclusion from their land, Israel\u2019s\nexistence as a state may very well set the stage for the final act.\n2. Perilous times\nPaul described the social conditions of the \u201clast days\u201d:\nBut know this, that in the last days perilous times will\ncome: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of\nmoney, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to par-\nents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slander-\ners, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors,\nheadstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers\nof God, having a form of godliness but denying its power.\nAnd from such people turn away! For of this sort are those\nwho creep into households and make captives of gullible\nwomen loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,\nalways learning and never able to come to the knowledge\nof the truth (2 Tim. 3:1-7).\n\nOf course the people Paul described have always existed; however, when\nthe depravity he described characterizes a whole society, such a condition sig-\nnals the approach of the end of this age. Many view today\u2019s prevailing condi-\ntions of selfishness, sexual perversion, crime, violence, lack of conscience and\nrebellion against biblical morality as signs that we are a \u201cdoomsday\u201d society.\n3. Modern weapons and war potential\nJust before Jesus returns with His saints to claim His kingdom, the earth\nwill be the scene of the greatest war of all time called \u201cArmageddon\u201d (Rev.\n16:16; 19:17-21). This war will be the final conflict of this dispensation. At\nthe turn of the twentieth century a war of the proportion of Armageddon\nwas difficult to conceive. Now, with the development of nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction, another world war would undoubtedly\nbe the last war and would bring about the destruction of humankind. In this\nsense, the modern war potential is a latter day sign because only the second\ncoming of Jesus can prevent total destruction.\n4. Progress in transportation and science\nThe last chapter of Daniel\u2019s prophecy records this word of the Lord: \u201cBut\nyou, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end;\nmany shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase\u201d (Dan. 12:4). This\nprophecy seems to indicate that in the end times there will be a notable accel-\neration in travel and in the acquisition of knowledge. Many who write about\nlatter day signs point to Daniel\u2019s prophecy as a sign that the end is approaching.\nUntil the nineteenth century, there was very little change in the way peo-\nple traveled. Abraham could get from one place to another about as rapidly\nas Shakespeare could. Until the turn of the twentieth century, the average\nperson traveled in a vehicle drawn by animals. Today, individuals span conti-\nnents through air travel in a matter of hours.\nThe increase in knowledge has been equally spectacular. Until the inven-\ntion of the printing press and the discovery of the new world, the sum of\n\nhuman knowledge was not appreciably greater than it was in the Golden\nAge of Greece and Rome. The Renaissance was primarily a rediscovery of\nthe cultures of ancient Greece, Egypt, Arabia and China. Buckminster Fuller\nobserved that before 1900 human knowledge doubled almost every century.\nHowever, Fuller noted by the conclusion of World War II knowledge was\ndoubling at least every 25 years. IBM has predicted that internet technology\nwill eventually lead to the \u201cdoubling of knowledge every 12 hours.\u201d8 This\natmosphere of exploding knowledge and rapid scientific advancement in a\nworld of declining morality, increased unethical behavior and selfish individ-\nualism will most assuredly lead to the return of Jesus to rule and to save us\nfrom ourselves.\nThese general, inferential signs and conditions in society are to be looked\nfor before the rapture of the church. However, the explicit signs are proph-\nesied in the Bible to happen during the tribulation and in connection with\nthe Lord\u2019s return in judgment. Believers should be aware that no specific sign\nmust happen before the Bridegroom comes for the bride. Christ\u2019s appearing,\nas in the parable of the ten virgins, should be expected at all times (Matt.\n25:1-13).\nE. The rapture of the church\nA number of events are associated with the end of the age. Jesus prom-\nised His disciples, \u201c\u2026I will come again and receive you to Myself; that\nwhere I am, there you may be also\u201d (John 14:3). Paul wrote: \u201c\u2026And the\ndead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be\ncaught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air\u201d\n(1 Thess. 4:16-17). Jesus spoke also of great tribulation, \u201cFor then there will\nbe great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world\nuntil this time, no, nor ever shall be\u201d (Matt. 24:21). This great tribulation\nis described in detail in Revelation 6-19 (see also Dan. 12:1). The tribula-\ntion will be caused by Satan through the agency of one called variously \u201ca\nbeast\u201d (Rev. 13:1), the \u201cantichrist\u201d (1 John 2:18), the \u201cman of sin\u2026son of\n8David Russell Schilling, \u201cKnowledge Doubling Every 12 Months, Soon to be Every 12 Hours\u201d Industry Tap.\nApril 19, 2013.\nhttp://www.industrytap.com/knowledge-doubling-every-12-months-soon-to-be-every-12-hours/3950\n\nperdition\u201d (2 Thess. 2:3) and \u201canother horn, a little one\u201d (Dan. 7:8). The\ngreat tribulation will be concluded by the battle of Armageddon and the\nrevelation of Jesus as king of kings, who will come with His armies of saints\nto bring judgment upon the \u201cbeast\u201d and his followers (Rev. 19:11-21). The\ngreat tribulation is followed by the millennial reign of Christ, the final judg-\nment and the eternal state (Rev. 20-22).\nThe New Testament, especially in Paul\u2019s writings, is clear about a \u201crap-\nture\u201d of the living believers at Christ\u2019s coming. Most evangelicals agree that a\nrapture will occur, but they are not in agreement about when the rapture will\noccur in relation to the tribulation period described in the book of Revelation.\nWhich of the rapture events will happen first? Will it be the coming of Jesus\nor the revelation of the Antichrist? Will Christians face the final tribulation,\nor will they be raptured before the tribulation occurs? While this book identi-\nfies with the pre-tribulation rapture position, the authors refrain from radical\ndogmatism in the presentation of this position recognizing that godly and\nscholarly teachers take other positions.\n1. The pre-tribulation rapture theory\nPre-tribulation proponents believe the church will be raptured before the\nfinal tribulation. They believe the \u201cblessed hope\u201d mentioned in Titus 2:13 is\nthe pre-tribulation rapture of the church:\nFor this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we\nwho are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord\nwill by no means precede those who are asleep. For the\nLord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with\nthe voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God.\nAnd the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are\nalive and remain shall be caught up together with them in\nthe clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall\nalways be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another\nwith these words (1 Thess. 4:15-18).\n\nThe apostle Paul was given a special revelation from the Lord Himself\nregarding the details of the rapture and its relationship to the resurrection.9\nIn 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 Paul again spoke of the rapture of the church\ntogether with the bodily resurrection of deceased believers: \u201cBehold, I tell you\na mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed\u2014in a moment,\nin the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound,\nand the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\u201d When\nthe Lord comes for His church, not only will the living saints be raptured,\nbut their bodies will also be changed into glorified, imperishable bodies. The\nbeliever, body and spirit, will become like Jesus (1 John 3:2-3). Another refer-\nence by Paul to the rapture is found in 2 Thessalonians 2:1: \u201cNow, brethren,\nconcerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together\nto Him\u2026\u201d There is probably an additional reference to the rapture in the\nsame passage: \u201c\u2026for that day will not come unless the falling away comes\nfirst\u2026\u201d (v. 3). The Greek word translated \u201cfalling away,\u201d may also have the\nmeaning \u201cdeparture\u201d (see 2 Cor. 12:8, \u201cdepart\u201d). The word in Greek has the\ndefinite article; therefore, it refers to an event known by the recipients. Since\nthe whole subject is about the \u201crapture\u201d and the concern of the Thessalonians\nthat they were already in the tribulation, the rendering \u201cdeparture\u201d is a rea-\nsonable one.10\nThose who hold to the pre-tribulation rapture theory believe the tribula-\ntion period will occur when \u201cthe fullness of the Gentiles has come in\u201d (Rom.\n11:12, 25-27). Therefore, the tribulation is not a church period but is the\nfinal or seventieth week of Daniel\u2019s vision regarding God\u2019s dealing with unbe-\nlieving Israel: \u201cSeventy weeks are determined For your people and for your\nholy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make rec-\nonciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness\u2026\u201d (Dan. 9:24;\nsee also vv. 25-27). It is a time of God dealing with unbelieving Israel and of\n\u201cthe wrath of the Lamb\u201d (Rev. 6:15-17). The tribulation period is called by\nJeremiah \u201cJacob\u2019s trouble\u201d (Jer. 30:4-7). Paul declared regarding the church:\n\u201cFor God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our\n9 See Roy Hicks, Another Look at the Rapture (Tulsa, OK: Harrison House, 1982), where an extended treatment\nis made of Paul\u2019s special insight into the rapture.\n10 See Kenneth S. Wuest, The New Testament, an Expanded Translation (Eerdmans, 1972) 486; Roy Hicks,\nAnother Look at the Rapture (Harrison House, 1982) 45-49.\n\nLord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (1 Thess. 5:9). Proponents of the pre-tribulation theory\nbelieve the church has suffered and will suffer many trials and tribulations but\nnot the final tribulation, which will include \u201cthe wrath of the Lamb!\u201d (Rev.\n6:16). They believe the Lord has promised the faithful that they will be kept\nfrom that hour of wrath: \u201cBecause you have kept My command to persevere,\nI also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole\nworld, to test those who dwell on the earth\u201d (Rev. 3:10; see also 2 Pet. 2:9;\nLuke 21:34-36).\nPre-tribulation rapture proponents point out that in the book of Revelation\nafter Chapter Four the word \u201cchurch\u201d is not specifically mentioned until\nRevelation 19, where the church is seen in heaven as the bride of Christ. Some\nscholars identify the church with the four and twenty elders who are in heaven\nthroughout the apocalypse. The four and twenty elders are arrayed in white\nwith crowns of victory on their heads, symbols of the redeemed. These scholars\nbelieve the tribulation saints (those who are saved during the tribulation and\nmartyred) are seen as a group only in heaven. They believe the righteous who\nare seen on earth are the 144,000 who are said to be Jews (Rev. 7:1-8; 14:1-5).\nOne of the strongest arguments for a pre-tribulation rapture is the fact that\nthroughout the New Testament believers are exhorted to look for and wait for\nthe coming of Jesus (Matt. 24:42-43; 25:13; Mark 13:35; 1 Thess. 5:6; Titus\n2:13; 1 John 3:3; Heb. 9:28). Jesus promised, \u201cAnd if I go and prepare a place\nfor you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you\nmay be also\u201d (John 14:3). Here Jesus\u2019 second coming is for the purpose of\nreceiving the church to Himself and taking her to a place in the Father\u2019s house.\nThe blessed hope of an imminent coming of Jesus is one of the strongest incen-\ntives to practical godliness and diligent service (Titus 2:12-14; 1 John 3:3). If\nthe tribulation must come first with the manifestation of the Antichrist before\nthe rapture, individuals might not urgently look for a coming of Jesus until\nmany of the events of the apocalypse have transpired. The parable of the faith-\nful and unfaithful servants recorded in Matthew 24 teaches the tragic result of\nsaying, \u201cMy master is delaying his coming\u201d (24:44-51).\nThe principal proponents of the pre-tribulation position are Dr. C.I.\nScofield, Scofield Study Bible, footnotes, (Oxford University Press, 1967); Dr.\n\nJohn F. Walvoord, The Rapture Question (Dunham, 1957); The Revelation of\nJesus Christ (Moody Press, 1972); Dr. Kenneth S. Wuest, Prophetic Light in the\nPresent Darkness (Eerdmans, 1956); Dr. J.

Stanton, Kept\nfrom the Hour (Zondervan, 1956); Dr. Charles C. Ryrie, The Ryrie Study Bible\n(Moody Press, 1978); Dispensationalism Today (Moody Press, 1981).\n2. The post-tribulation rapture theory\nThose with the post-tribulation rapture theory claim believers will go\nthrough the tribulation and that the rapture will occur simultaneously with or\nimmediately before the Lord\u2019s coming in judgment. They hold that the rapture\nof the church and Christ\u2019s return to rule are simply different aspects of a single\nevent that will happen at the end of the great tribulation, immediately before\nthe defeat of the beast and his followers and the beginning of the millennium.\nThey believe the Bible describes the second coming of Christ as one event,\nnot two events separated by a seven or three and a half year interval of tribu-\nlation. They point to Jesus warning His disciples and followers to be prepared\nfor unequaled tribulation that would precede His second coming (Matt. 24:3-\n22; John 15:18-19; 16:33). They note that the resurrection of the dead and\nthe rapture are closely associated in Scripture, with Revelation 20:4-6 placing\nthe \u201cfirst resurrection\u201d after Christ\u2019s return to rule, just before the millennium.\nThis suggests that the rapture will occur after the tribulation at the moment\nof Christ\u2019s second coming (see also Dan. 12:1-2). Some of the best advocates\nof the post-tribulation rapture are Dr. George E. Ladd, in The Blessed Hope\n(Eerdmans, 1957); A Theology of the New Testament (Zondervan, 1977) and J.\nBarton Payne, in Encyclopedia of Biblical Prophecy (Harper & Row, 1973).\n3. The mid-tribulation rapture theory\nAs the term \u201cmid-tribulation\u201d reveals, those who profess the mid-tribu-\nlation rapture theory believe the church will be raptured after the first half of\nDaniel\u2019s seventieth week, in the middle of the tribulation period (Dan. 9:27).\n\nHowever, most who hold this view claim to be pre-tribulation rapturists\nbecause they do not interpret the first half of the seven-year tribulation period\nto be a time of great tribulation or wrath. Those who believe in a mid-tribulation\nrapture identify the last trumpet, mentioned in connection with the rapture\nin 1 Corinthians 15:52, to be identical to the seventh trumpet sounded in\nRevelations 11:15, which occurs in the middle of the tribulation (Rev. 11:2-\n3). If these two trumpets are identical, then this places the rapture at the\nmiddle of the tribulation. Mid-tribulation rapture theory states that the great\ntribulation is only the last half of Daniel\u2019s seventieth week (Dan. 9:27; Rev.\n11:2-3; 12:6, 14). Since the church is raptured before the \u201cgreat tribulation\u201d\n(the last three and one half years), the church escapes the \u201cwrath\u201d mentioned\nin 1 Thessalonians 5:9 and the \u201chour of temptation\u201d spoken of in Revelation\n3:10. Those who promote a mid-tribulation rapture theory view the resurrec-\ntion of the two witnesses in Revelation 11:11-12 as a reference to the rapture\nand resurrection of the church that happens mid-tribulation simultaneously\nwith the rapture.11\nThose who argue against this theory believe that the trumpets in\n1 Corinthians 15 and Revelation 11 are not the same. Paul\u2019s \u201ctrump of God\u201d\nis a trumpet call of victory over death; John\u2019s seventh trumpet is the seventh\nin a series of announcements of judgment upon the wicked and final triumph\nover Satan\u2019s reign. They also point out that Scripture seems to state that God\u2019s\nwrath is poured out in both the first and second halves of the tribulation\nperiod (Rev. 6:12-17; see also 1 Thess. 5:9; Rev. 3:10; 2 Pet. 2:9).\n4. The partial rapture theory\nThe partial rapture theory is a primary example of various,\nnon-gospel-centered, errant rapture theories. Those who hold to a partial\nrapture theory base their belief on misinterpreting or misapplying passages\nsuch as Hebrews 9:28, Luke 21:36, 1 John 2:28 and Matthew 25:1-13. They\ninterpret these passages to mean that believers who do not \u201ceagerly wait for\nHim,\u201d who are not \u201ccounted worthy,\u201d who have something in their lives that\n11 See J. Oliver Buswell, A Systematic Theology of the Christian Religion (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publish-\ning House, 1963) II, 456.\n\nmight make them \u201cashamed before Him at His coming\u201d or who do not have\noil (the fullness of the Spirit) will be left behind to go through the tribulation.\nAdvocates of this theory believe that only those believers who are fully worthy\nwill go up in the rapture.\nThe partial rapture theory is simply not supported by Scripture and\ncontradicts the basic principles of the gospel. First Thessalonians 4:16\nsays, \u201c\u2026the dead in Christ will rise first.\u201d If all who have died in Christ will\nbe resurrected, certainly all who are alive \u201cin Christ\u201d will be raptured. Most\nassuredly the Lord will not wait until His coming to make a new distinction\nbetween believers who are \u201cworthy\u201d and those who are not. All believers are\nequally worthy through the cross. Who can claim worthiness in himself or\nherself? Our standing with God is based on the righteousness of Christ, not\nour righteousness which is \u201cfilthy rags\u201d (Isa. 64:6). Although every believer\nshould be filled with the Spirit, the purpose of that fullness is not to save\nbelievers or make them worthy. Believers in the partial rapture theory wrongly\ninterpret the \u201coil\u201d in the parable of the ten virgins to be symbolic of the \u201cfull-\nness of the Spirit.\u201d The text clearly shows this is not the case as the wise and\nunwise all had oil at the beginning of the parable. Scripture simply does not\nteach that a partial rapture will occur based on how much Christians yield to\nthe Holy Spirit or pursue the will of God.\nF. Christ\u2019s return to rule: the revelation\nAt the rapture, Christ comes for His saints. At His revelation, Christ\ncomes with His saints. At the rapture, Christ comes in the air. At His revela-\ntion, Christ comes to earth to rule in power and glory. The rapture is followed\nby the believers\u2019 judgment of rewards and the marriage supper of the lamb.\nThe revelation is followed by the defeat of the Antichrist and the wicked\nnations and the establishment of Christ\u2019s millennial kingdom (Rev. 19-20).\n\u201cNow Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, say-\ning, \u201cBehold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints\u2026\u201d (Jude 14;\nsee also Dan. 7:9-10, 21-22; Isa. 11:1-4; 63:1-3). According to Revelation\n19-20, these are the steps in Christ\u2019s return to rule:\n\n1. Heaven is opened, and Christ appears riding on a white horse with\na crown on His head and with garments dipped in blood. His name is\nannounced to be \u201cThe Word of God\u201d (Rev. 19:11-13; see also John 1:1).\n2. He is accompanied by armies of saints also riding on white horses. A\nsharp sword issues from His mouth to smite the wicked nations. His title is\nrevealed to be \u201cKING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS\u201d (Rev. 19:14-16).\n3. An angel announces His readiness for battle against the beast, and Satan\u2019s\narmies gather to oppose the Lord. The beast\u2019s armies are crushed; the beast, the\nfalse prophet and all those who have taken the mark of the beast or worshiped\nhis image are cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-21; see also Dan. 8:25).\n4. An angel from heaven casts Satan, called \u201cthe old serpent,\u201d the \u201cdragon\u201d\nand the \u201cdevil,\u201d into the bottomless pit where he is imprisoned for a thousand\nyears (Rev. 20:1-3).\n5. The tribulation saints are raised. Together with the church saints, they\nreign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4; Matt. 25:21; 2 Tim. 2:12;\nRev. 5:9-10).\nV. The Tribulation\nA. The word \u201ctribulation\u201d in Scripture\nThe Bible uses the word \u201ctribulation\u201d in at least three different ways:\n1. Tribulation describes the trials and persecutions Christians will suffer\nin the world as a result of their identification with Christ: \u201cIn the world you\nwill have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world\u201d (John\n16:33). John explained why we suffer with Christ in this world: \u201cTherefore the\nworld does not know us, because it did not know Him\u201d (1 John 3:1; see also 2\nTim. 3:12; 2 Thess. 1:4; Acts 14:22; Rom. 12:12; Eph. 3:13; 2 Cor. 7:4).\n\n2. Tribulation refers to the final tribulation that will occur before the mil-\nlennial reign of Christ. Those who hold to a post-tribulation rapture theory\nbelieve the church will go through this final tribulation. Those who maintain\na pre-tribulation rapture position believe this time refers to a special period\nwhere God will deal with unbelieving Israel as prophesied by Daniel (Dan.\n9:24-27). They believe Jeremiah also made reference to the same period call-\ning it \u201cJacob\u2019s trouble\u201d (Jer. 30:7-9). They point to Jesus describing the \u201cgreat\ntribulation\u201d (Matt. 24:15-28) and confirming the tribulation\u2019s application to\nIsrael by using terms such as \u201cJudea,\u201d \u201cSabbath\u201d and \u201cabomination of deso-\nlation\u201d (Dan. 9:27) which refers to the desecration of the altar of the Jewish\ntemple by the Antichrist.\n3. Tribulation applies to God\u2019s final wrath upon the Antichrist and the\nGentile nations that follow him (Rev. 6:12-17). This tribulation is called the\n\u201cgreat day of His wrath.\u201d\nIndividuals should clearly distinguish between the different applications\nand uses of the word tribulation. The fact that all believers must be ready\nto suffer trials and tribulations (Acts 14:22) does not necessarily mean that\nChristians will go through the \u201cgreat tribulation\u201d or the final hour of \u201cGod\u2019s\nwrath.\u201d Although respected scholars disagree, it is the pre-tribulation rap-\nture position of this book that God has promised to keep the church saints\n\u201cfrom\u201d (Greek ek, \u201cout of\u201d) the tribulation period (Rev. 3:10; 1 Thess. 5:9).\nFurthermore, we believe the \u201cgreat tribulation,\u201d which is Daniel\u2019s \u201cseventi-\neth week\u201d of the period determined for dealing with Israel (Dan. 9:24-27;\n12:8-13), is not a part of the church age. We believe when the \u201cfullness of\nthe Gentiles\u201d comes, as Paul explained in Romans 11:25, the church will be\nraptured, and God will turn again to effect the salvation of national Israel\n(Rom. 11:24, 26; Rev. 7:4-8; Rev. 11-12).\nB. Daniel\u2019s dream and vision\nDaniel also prophesied about times of world domination by Gentile\nnations in the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s image (Dan. 2:31-44)\nand in Daniel\u2019s dream of the four beasts (Dan. 7:1-14). The four parts of\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s image and the four beasts in Daniel\u2019s dream represented\n\nfour, successive Gentile empires; the last was to be the Roman Empire.\nAccording to the dream of the image, the Roman Empire would be revived in\nthe form of ten kingdoms represented by the ten toes of the image. According\nto the vision of the four beasts, the fourth beast would have ten horns from\nwhich \u201canother horn, a little one,\u201d symbolizing the Antichrist, would come\nforth. In both the dream and the vision the Son of Man will come in the\ntime of the fourth empire to punish the nations and to set up His everlasting\nkingdom (Dan. 2:31-35; 7:8-14; 12:1-3). In Matthew 24 and in Luke 21\nJesus implied that the great tribulation will include Daniel\u2019s seventieth week\nof God\u2019s dealing with Israel and His final wrath against Satan and the wicked\nGentile nations that serve him (see also Zech. 14:1-4; Rev. 14:17-20; 16:14-\n16; 19:19-20).\nC. Principal events of the tribulation:\n1. The church and the restrainer of evil are removed (2 Thess. 2:1, 7-8).\n2. The daily sacrifice is restored in a rebuilt temple by covenant with the\nAntichrist (Dan. 9:27).\n3. Judgments are poured out from the opening of the seven seals (Rev.\n6:1-8:1).\n4. Judgments are poured out from the sounding of the seven trumpets\n(Rev. 8:6-11:15).\n5. The daily sacrifice is taken away by the Antichrist, and the abomina-\ntion of desolation is set up (Dan. 9:27; 12:10-11; Matt. 24:15).\nThis will happen in the middle of the seven years which are divided into\ntwo parts of three and one half years each (Rev. 11:2-3; 12:14; Dan. 9:27;\n12:11). The latter half of this period is considered to be the \u201cgreat tribulation.\u201d\n6. Israel faces increased persecution (Rev. 12); 144,000 Jews from the 12\ntribes are sealed (Rev. 7:1-8); an innumerable company of tribulation saints\n\nfrom all nations, converted during the tribulation, are taken to heaven (Rev.\n7:9-17).\n7. Power and great authority is given to the beast and the false prophet;\nthe mark of the beast and his number are introduced with compulsory wor-\nship of the beast\u2019s image (Rev. 13).\n8. Judgments result from the outpouring of the seven vials of wrath (Rev.\n15-16).\n9. \u201cThe great harlot\u201d or \u201cMYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE\nMOTHER OF HARLOTS\u201d (Rev. 17-18), who probably represents apostate\nreligion, faces judgment.\nOrganized religion \u201c\u2026having a form of godliness but denying its\npower\u201d (2 Tim. 3:5) will become increasingly corrupt, even aligning with the\nbeast\u2019s government.\n10. The kings of the east and the armies of the Antichrist (beast) will\ngather to make war with the remnant of Israel resulting in the battle of\nArmageddon (Rev. 12:17; 16:12-16).\n11. The marriage supper of the Lamb is celebrated (Rev. 19:6-9).\n12. Christ returns with His armies of saints to confront the beast and\nhis armies, and the beast\u2019s armies are destroyed by the brightness of Christ\u2019s\ncoming (Rev. 19:14-21; 2 Thess. 2:8).\n13. The beast and the false prophet are cast into the lake of fire (Rev.\n19:20).\n14. Satan is cast into the bottomless pit (the abyss) for one thousand\nyears (Rev. 20:1-3).\n\nVI. The Antichrist\nA. The word \u201cantichrist\u201d in Scripture\nThe word \u201cantichrist\u201d comes from two Greek words: christos meaning\n\u201cChrist\u201d or \u201canointed one\u201d and anti meaning \u201cagainst.\u201d Therefore, antichrist\nmeans \u201cthe one against Christ, God\u2019s anointed.\u201d The word antichrist is found\nonly in John\u2019s epistles (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7) where antichrist is\ndescribed as one coming in the last time and one whose spirit is already pres-\nent in the world. The spirit of antichrist will be embodied in the \u201cbeast\u201d\ndescribed in Revelation 11:7 and 13:1. The first prophetic reference to the\nAntichrist is probably found in Genesis 3:15: \u201cAnd I will put enmity Between\nyou and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed\u2026\u201d Christ is the\n\u201cSeed\u201d of the woman. Antichrist is the \u201cseed\u201d of Satan or the devil, whose\nname means \u201cslanderer,\u201d who speaks against Christ and against His redeemed.\nB. The identity of the Antichrist\nThe spirit of antichrist has possessed many enemies of God through the\nages such as \u201cthe kings of Babylon,\u201d a type of Satan (Isa. 14:4-17). The \u201cgreat\nharlot\u201d is given the name \u201cMYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE\nMOTHER OF HARLOTS\u201d in Revelation 17:5 for she is the embodiment\nof anti-God religion. Throughout history many anti-Christian rulers and evil\nmen of power such as Nero, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Mussolini, Hitler\nand Stalin have been identified as the Antichrist. Some of these men were\nclearly motivated by the spirit of antichrist, but the Antichrist is yet to come.\nThe spirit of antichrist will continue to possess any person yielded to Satan.\nC. The titles of the Antichrist\n1. The beast (Rev. 13:1-4,12-18; 15:2; 16:2; 17:8; 19:19; 20:4, 10)\n2. The little horn (Dan. 7:8; 8:9)\nHe shall rise up from among rulers of the revived Roman Empire. The\n\u201clittle horn\u201d of Daniel 8:9 is Antiochus Epiphanes (170 B.C.), the Syrian ruler\n\nwho persecuted the Jews and defiled the temple in the time of the Maccabees\n(1 Macc. 1:10-47); therefore, he is a type of antichrist.\n3. The man of sin (2 Thess. 2:3)\nHe will be history\u2019s vilest embodiment of sin and rebellion.\n4. The son of perdition (2 Thess. 2:3)\nThis is another title of the man of sin. The Antichrist is Satan\u2019s tool to\nseduce humans and consign them to the realm of the lost.\n5. The lawless one (2 Thess. 2:8)\nHe totally opposes every law of God.\n6. The willful king (Dan. 11:36-45)\nJesus prayed, \u201c\u2026not My will, but Yours, be done\u201d (Luke 22:42). The\nAntichrist will oppose God\u2019s will and do his own will; he is the inspirer of all\nthose who \u201cdo their own thing.\u201d\n7. The foolish shepherd (Zech. 11:15-17)\nJesus is the \u201cgood shepherd\u201d (John 10:11-18) who preserves. The\nAntichrist is the worthless shepherd who devours.\nD. The works of the Antichrist\n1. He is the last ruler of the revived Roman Empire (Dan. 7:8; Rev. 13:1).\n2. He will appear on the scene as a proponent of peace who is tolerant of\nreligion (Dan. 9:27; Rev. 6:2; 1 Thess. 5:3).\n\n3. He will arise at the beginning of the seventieth week of Daniel and\nusher in the great tribulation when God sets His hand to deal again with\nnational Israel. He will make a covenant with unbelieving Jews to restore the\ndaily sacrifice (Dan. 9:24-27).\n4. After three and one half years in the middle of the tribulation, he will\ncast off all pretense of toleration, break his covenant with the Jews, cause the\ndaily sacrifice to cease and begin his persecution of Israel (Rev. 13:6-8).\n5. One of his heads will receive a deadly wound then be miraculously\nhealed causing the world to marvel, follow and worship him (Rev. 13:3-4).\n6. As the man of sin and the lawless one, he will blaspheme God and\nrequire \u201cAll who dwell on the earth\u201d to \u201cworship him\u201d or face death (Rev.\n13:7-8).\n7. The third member of the satanic trinity (the dragon, the beast and the\nfalse prophet) will arise. The false prophet will exercise miraculous power to\ndeceive, cause people to worship the beast, create an image of the beast to\nwhich he gives life and require all humans to take a mark or number of the\nbeast to buy or sell (Rev. 13:11-18).\n8. During the tribulation the beast will sponsor the great harlot who\nrepresents apostate religion, but finally the beast, together with the ten kings\nwho rule with the beast, will utterly destroy the scarlet woman (Rev. 17).\nThe woman is said to be \u201cthat great city which reigns over the kings of\nthe earth\u201d (Rev. 17:18). The city is situated on \u201cseven mountains\u201d (Rev. 17:9).\nScholars are divided as to whether the city is Rome or Babylon.\n9. The beast will gather his subject nations together to make war with\nthe Lamb at the battle of Armageddon, where he will be utterly defeated and\ncast, together with the false prophet, into the lake of fire (Rev. 16:16; 17:14;\n19:19-20).\n\nVII. The Resurrection\nAlmost all religions teach the immortality of the soul, but the Bible\nteaches the redemption of and the survival of the total person: spirit, soul\nand body. The ancient Greeks believed in life after death for the soul, but\nsince they believed the body was the source of all evil, they thought it was\nnecessary for the soul to be released from the body. A heretical Christian sect\ncalled \u201cGnostics\u201d shared this concept derived from Greek philosophy. The\nBible does not teach that the physical body is the source of evil. When Paul\ninstructed the church not to live \u201caccording to the flesh\u201d (kata sarka), but\n\u201caccording to the Spirit\u201d (kata pneuma), he was not saying that the body is the\nsource of all evil (Rom. 8:1-17). Instead, he was pointing out that although\nsin manifests itself through the actions of the body, evil behavior is derived\nfrom a \u201ccarnal mind\u201d (Rom. 8:6-7). Moreover, Christ, through His incar-\nnation, death and resurrection, took our human body and \u201ccondemned sin\nin the flesh\u201d (Rom. 8:3). He has redeemed the total person who is in Christ\ngiving every believer a hope of a bodily resurrection that will occur at the\nrapture of the church: \u201cFor since by man came death, by Man also came the\nresurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be\nmade alive. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward\nthose who are Christ\u2019s at His coming\u201d (1 Cor. 15:21-23).\nA. The fact of the resurrection\nThe fact of the resurrection is taught in both the Old and the New Testaments:\n1. In the Old Testament\na) By affirmation: \u201cFor I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall\nstand at last on the earth; And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in\nmy flesh I shall see God\u2026\u201d (Job 19:25-26). The psalmist proclaimed, \u201cAs for\nme, I will see Your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake in\nYour likeness\u201d (Ps. 17:15; see also Ps. 16:9-11; Dan. 12:2).\nb) By prophecy: \u201cYour dead shall live; Together with my dead body they\nshall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust; For your dew is like the\n\ndew of herbs, And the earth shall cast out the dead\u201d (Isa. 26:19; see also\nHosea 13:14).\nc) By typology: Events such as Joseph\u2019s deliverance from the pit are typ-\nical of death and resurrection (Gen. 37:20-36), as is Isaac\u2019s return from the\naltar of sacrifice (Gen. 22:5-14) and Jonah\u2019s deliverance from the great fish\n(Jon. 2; Matt. 12:40).\nd) By example: The Old Testament contains several examples of persons\nwho were raised from the dead (1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 4:32-35; 13:20-\n21). While these are cases of resuscitation rather than resurrection (for those\nwho were raised died natural deaths later), they demonstrate God\u2019s power and\ndisposition to restore dead bodies to life.\n2. In the New Testament\na) By affirmation: \u201cSo also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is\nsown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is\nraised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power\u201d (1 Cor. 15:42-43;\nsee also Matt. 22:30-32; John 5:21; Acts 23:6-8; 26:8-23; 2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Pet.\n1:3).\nb) By prophecy: \u201cDo not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which\nall who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth\u2014those who have\ndone good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the\nresurrection of condemnation\u201d (John 5:28-29; see also John 6:39-40, 44, 54;\nLuke 14:13-14; 20:35-36; 1 Cor. 15; Phil. 3:11, 21; 1 Thess. 4:14-16; Rev.\n20:4-6, 13-15).\nc) By example: The New Testament also contains examples of persons\nraised from the dead. These were not resurrections such as will occur at the\nsecond coming and at the last judgment, for these individuals later died and will\nexperience the final resurrection. However, these stories of individuals being raised\nfrom the dead are prefigures of the final resurrection (see John 11:41-44, Lazarus;\n\nLuke 8:41-56, Jairus\u2019 daughter; Luke 7:12-15, the widow\u2019s son; Matt. 27:52-\n53, Old Testament saints).\nThe resurrection of Jesus is the true and ideal resurrection. When Jesus\nrose from the dead, He became \u201c\u2026the firstfruits of those who have fallen\nasleep\u201d (1 Cor. 15:20). His resurrection is the guarantee of the resurrection\nof all believers: \u201cBut God... raised us up together, and made us sit together in\nthe heavenly places in Christ Jesus\u2026\u201d (Eph. 2:4-6).\nB. The nature of the resurrection\nThe resurrection of humans will be universal. Not all humans will have\neternal life, but all will have eternal existence. All persons will be resurrected:\nthe just to eternal life, the unjust to eternal condemnation. All humans will be\nraised from the dead but not all at the same time (John 5:28-29).\n1. The resurrection of believers (1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:50-57; Rev.\n20:4-6)\nThe resurrection of the church will occur at the second coming of Jesus\n(1 Thess. 4:16). The believers\u2019 resurrection is called the \u201cfirst resurrection\u201d:\n\u201cBlessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the\nsecond death has no power\u2026\u201d (Rev. 20:6). Some teach there will be one gen-\neral resurrection of the dead and one judgment when the just and unjust are\njudged. Jesus sometimes mentioned the two resurrections and judgments in\nthe same passage, but a careful reading will reveal that Jesus was not speaking\nof one general resurrection: \u201cand come forth\u2014those who have done good, to\nthe resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of\ncondemnation\u201d (John 5:29). Notice that one is a resurrection of life while the\nother is a resurrection of condemnation. They are not the same, nor do they\noccur at the same time as Paul and John both elucidated.\nIt is normal for prophetic passages to present several, related future events\nas if they were one event. For example, the first and second coming of Jesus\nare merged in the same passage in Old Testament prophecy (Isa. 9:6-7;\n61:1-3; Dan. 12:2). Both Paul and John made it clear that the resurrection of\n\nthe saints will take place at Christ\u2019s second coming before the millennial reign\n(1 Cor. 15:51-52; Rev. 20:4-6; Dan. 12:1-2).\na) The resurrection of humans will be a literal, bodily resurrection. This\ntruth is demonstrated by the resurrection of Jesus. His resurrected body still\nbore the prints of the nails and the wound of the sword (John 20:26-28).\nAfter His resurrection, Jesus had a body of \u201cflesh and bones\u201d and even took\nfood to eat (Luke 24:36-43). On the other hand, the body of Jesus was suf-\nficiently glorified that His disciples did not always recognize Him at once.\nHis appearances show that His body was not subject to normal physical lim-\nitations (John 20:19, 26). Although our resurrection will be literal, this does\nnot mean that all the same molecules of our dead bodies will be recovered. In\nfact, our body cells are replaced many times throughout our lifespan without\nour losing personal identity. Of this we may be certain: God will form our\nresurrected bodies with a definite relationship to our earthly bodies, but they\nwill be transformed and fashioned to our new environment (Phil. 3:21).\nPaul spoke of death as a sowing of the body as a farmer sows seed. The\nseed dies, but it contains a life principle by which nature brings forth a new\nplant of the same genus, species and variety as the original seed. At the res-\nurrection, cemeteries will turn into harvest fields (1 Cor. 15:42-44). Out of\nplanted earthly bodies, the Lord will raise up resurrection bodies that are\nidentified with their earthly body but transformed with a likeness to Christ\u2019s\nresurrection body. Believers\u2019 bodies will be changed (1 Cor. 15:52), but each\nwill have a relationship to their earthly body. The resurrection body will not\nmerely be the earthly body resuscitated, but the likeness of the earthly body\nglorified. Jesus\u2019 state after His resurrection demonstrates that our resurrection\nbodies will retain their personal identity.\nb) The resurrection body will be God-given: \u201cBut God gives it a body as\nHe pleases\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 15:38). This is the answer to the hypothetical questions\n\u201c\u2026How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?\u201d (1 Cor.\n15:35). How a dead body can be raised and glorified cannot be conceived by\nhuman intellect. Christ\u2019s resurrection is one of the great miracles of our gospel.\nWe do not explain it. We accept it as divine revelation. In the same manner,\nwe accept bodily resurrection as a miracle of divine power and wisdom. If we\n\naccept Christ\u2019s resurrection (which is one of the best attested events of history),\nwe should have no problem accepting our final resurrection, for we will be\nraised up to life by the same omnipotent God who raised Jesus from the dead.\nc) The believer\u2019s resurrection body will be immortal and incorruptible\n(1 Cor. 15:42). The Scripture never speaks of the immortality of the soul only,\nseparate from the body. Believers now have eternal life but dwell in mortal bod-\nies. All humans have an eternal existence. Only believers, who shall experience\n\u201cthe first resurrection,\u201d will receive immortal and incorruptible bodies (1 Cor.\n15:42).\nd) The resurrection body will be a celestial or heavenly body (1 Cor.\n15:40). Our earthly bodies are suited to this present, earthly environment.\nThe resurrection body will be suited to our new, heavenly environment. Our\nresurrected bodies will be equally suited to both the new heavens and the new\nearth as well as to the millennial earth. Like the body of Jesus, it will be able\nto come and go between heaven and the earth.\ne) The resurrection body will be a powerful body: \u201c\u2026It is sown in weak-\nness, it is raised in power\u201d (1 Cor. 15:43). The contrast here indicates that the\nnew capacities of the resurrection body will be inconceivably and inexpress-\nibly greater than those of any earthly, human body.\nf) The resurrection body will be a glorious body: \u201cIt is sown in dishonor,\nit is raised in glory\u201d (1 Cor. 15:43). Jesus promised, \u201cThen the righteous will\nshine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\u201d (Matt. 13:43). Jesus\u2019\nwords suggest that the resurrected saints will have the same glory that He\nmanifested on the Mount of Transfiguration: \u201c\u2026and He was transfigured\nbefore them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as\nthe light\u201d (Matt. 17:2). Jesus prayed for us, \u201cAnd the glory which You gave\nMe I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one\u2026\u201d (John\n17:22). After speaking of the resurrection, Daniel said, \u201cThose who are wise\nshall shine Like the brightness of the firmament, And those who turn many\nto righteousness Like the stars forever and ever\u201d (Dan. 12:3).\n\n2. The resurrection of unbelievers (Rev. 20:5,12-14; John 5:28-29; Dan.\n12:2; Acts 24:15)\nThe Bible does not reveal specifically the state or nature of the resurrection\nbodies of the unrighteous; however, we may assume that they will be bodies\nsubject to continuous ruin. Jesus said, \u201cAnd do not fear those who kill the body\nbut cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy [apollumi, \u201cto\nruin utterly\u201d] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]\u201d (Matt. 10:28). The bodies\nof the unrighteous dead will not be annihilated but they will suffer \u201cutter ruin\u201d\neternally (see 2 Thess. 1:8-9). The unrighteous are not resurrected at the time\nof Christ\u2019s second coming but after the millennial reign of Christ (Rev. 20:5).\nC. The time of the resurrection\nThe order of resurrections is as follows:\n1. The resurrection of Jesus (Matt. 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-14; Luke 24:1-\n39; John 20:1-17)\n2. A resurrection of Old Testament saints (Matt. 27:52-53)\n3. The resurrection of the church saints at the rapture (John 14:3;\n1 Thess. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52)\n4. The resurrection of the two witnesses of Revelation 11:12\n5. The resurrection of the saints of Israel and of the tribulation saints\nwho are witnesses for Christ and who do not worship the beast (Rev. 20:4-6;\nDan. 12:1-2)\n6. The resurrection of the unrighteous\nThe resurrection of the unrighteous will occur after the millennial reign\nof Christ. They will be resurrected to stand before the great white throne\n(Rev. 20:5, 11-14).\n\nVIII. The Millennium\nThe word \u201cmillennium\u201d is not found in the Bible; however, the thou-\nsand-year period of Christ\u2019s rule over the earth is mentioned six times in\nRevelation 20. The word millennium is derived from Latin, meaning \u201cthou-\nsand years.\u201d The millennium is a period when Satan will be bound in the\nabyss: \u201cHe laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and\nSatan, and bound him for a thousand years\u2026\u201d (Rev. 20:2). The binding\nof Satan will prepare the earth for the millennial reign of Christ, who will\ncome to earth, as described in Revelation 19:16, as \u201cKING OF KINGS AND\nLORD OF LORDS.\u201d The resurrected church saints, together with the trib-\nulation saints, will reign with Christ in His millennial kingdom: \u201cAnd they\nlived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years\u201d (Rev. 20:4; see also Rev.\n20:6).\nA. The relation of the millennium to the second coming\nThere are three theories about the time relationship of the millennium to\nthe second coming of Christ:\n1. Post-millennialism\nPost-millennialism puts the millennium before the second coming of\nJesus. According to this theory, based on an interpretation of the parables\nof the \u201cleaven\u201d and the \u201cmustard seed,\u201d the church will gradually, through\nthe preaching of the gospel and the promotion of social justice, overcome\nwar and evil in the world, after which Christ will come. Post-millennialists\nbelieve universal peace and righteousness will be accomplished gradually by\nthe church rather than by the second coming of Christ in power. World wars,\nconsistent crime and perpetual violence argue against this optimistic theory.\n2. Amillennialism\nAmillennialists do not believe Jesus will literally, physically reign on the\nearth for a thousand years. They spiritualize all references relative to Christ\u2019s\n\nthousand-year reign and apply them to His spiritual rule over the hearts of\nbelievers. They view Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ\u2019s ruling\non the throne of David to be addressing Christ\u2019s general relationship with\nthe church. They view all promises to Israel as fulfilled through Christ bless-\ning the church, inasmuch as the church is the spiritual Israel. According to\namillennial theory, national Israel has no further destiny than the destiny of\nother nations. Paul\u2019s teaching about the natural and wild branches of the olive\ntree in Romans 11 seems to refute this spiritual or figurative interpretation\nof Israel.\n3. Pre-millennialism\nPre-millennialists interpret Scripture literally, or more aptly, naturally.\nDifferences in the method of interpretation of prophecy lead to differences\nin theory. When individuals depart from a natural interpretation of Bible\nprophecy, they can only speculate. If everything is interpreted as a symbol\nrather than a real event, the symbols can be made to mean anything the inter-\npreter wants them to mean. Taking the book of Revelation and the kingdom\nprophecies naturally, the pre-millennialists believe that when Christ comes\nagain, He will then, and only then, establish His reign of peace and righteous-\nness over the earth. Pre-millennialists believe in a literal rule of Christ on the\npromised throne of David, when Jesus, together with the redeemed, will reign\nover the regathered and saved remnant of Israel and the righteous Gentile\nnations. Pre-millennialists do not confuse scriptural references to Israel with\nreferences to the church; nor do they confuse the church age with the mil-\nlennial age. As a result most pre-millennialists hold to the following order for\nfuture prophetic events:\na) The tribulation with a pre-, mid- or post-tribulation rapture\nb) The final second coming of Christ as king\nc) The millennial reign of Christ on earth\nd) The final judgment with the wicked thrown into the lake of fire\n\ne) The eternal state of a new heaven and a new earth for the redeemed\nB. The relation of the millennium to Israel\nAmong the millennial family of nations, the nation of Israel will occupy\nthe central place:\nWhen the Most High divided their inheritance to the\nnations, When He separated the sons of Adam, He set the\nboundaries of the peoples According to the number of the\nchildren of Israel. For the Lord\u2019s portion is His people;\nJacob is the place of His inheritance. \u201cHe found him in\na desert land And in the wasteland, a howling wilderness;\nHe encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the\napple of His eye\u201d (Deut. 32:8-10).\nThe angel Gabriel revealed to Mary that Jesus was destined, as the prom-\nised Messiah, to reign upon the throne of David: \u201cHe will be great, and will\nbe called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne\nof His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of\nHis kingdom there will be no end\u201d (Luke 1:32-33). It is true that the church\nhas entered into the spiritual blessings first given to Israel (Eph. 1:18, 3:6;\n1 Pet. 2:9-10); however, this fact does not change God\u2019s purpose for national\nIsrael (Isa. 61:1-62:4; 66:7-24; Rom. 11:13-28). It appears that Israel will\nbe the ministers and missionaries to all the nations during the millennium\ndirecting the Gentile inhabitants of the earth to serve and worship the Lord\n(Isa. 61:4-11). Israel will have preeminence among the nations during the\nmillennial reign of Christ, while the glorified church, composed of both Jews\nand Gentiles, will reign over the earth with Christ (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:29-\n30; 2 Tim 2:12).\nC. The relation of the millennium to the nations\nAt the coming of Christ to reign, there will be a judgment of Gentile\nnations referred to in Matthew as the \u201csheep\u201d and \u201cgoat\u201d nations (Matt.\n25:31-46). The sheep nations are judged for kingdom blessing on the basis\n\nof their treatment of the Lord\u2019s \u201cbrethren\u201d (Israel). Scripture clearly reveals\nthere will be Gentile nations on the millennial earth (see Rev. 20:7-8; Isa.\n2:1-5; 11:5-10; 60:1-5; Zech. 14:16-21). Daniel received revelation in a\nvision that the Christ would have dominion over a kingdom that would\ninclude all nations:\nI was watching in the night visions, And behold, One like\nthe Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He\ncame to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near\nbefore Him. Then to Him was given dominion and glory\nand a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages\nshould serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting domin-\nion, Which shall not pass away\u2026(Dan. 7:13-14).\nD. The relation of the millennium to the church\nThe church will bear a different relationship to the millennial kingdom\nthan either the restored nation of Israel or the Gentile nations. These latter\nbelievers will be earthly peoples. Even though they will live under the ideal\nconditions of an earth freed from the curse, they will have mortal bodies and\nthey will pursue normal, earthly occupations. There will be universal peace,\njustice and holiness because of the sovereign rule of Christ; however, there\nwill not be absolute perfection in the earthly inhabitants (see Isa. 11:4; 65:20;\nZech. 14:17-19). On the other hand, the church and all saints who have had\npart in the first resurrection will rule and reign with Christ (Rev. 2:26-27;\n3:21; 5:9-10; 20:6). They will not be confined to the earth, for they have\nglorified bodies, and they will have access to heaven and earth (Rev. 19:6-14;\nMatt. 22:30-31; Luke 20:35-36). Jesus said to His disciples, \u201cIn My Father\u2019s\nhouse are many mansions\u2026I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and\nprepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where\nI am, there you may be also\u201d (John 14:2-3). Paul spoke of his hope of a better\nplace than this earth: \u201c\u2026having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which\nis far better\u201d (Phil. 1:23). When Paul said for me \u201cto die is gain,\u201d he meant\n\u201cgain\u201d over life at its best, not at its worst, for he had just declared, \u201cfor to me\nto live is Christ\u201d (Phil 1:21). Even now, the believer is seated together with\nChrist in heavenly places (Eph. 2:6). Therefore, in our resurrected state we\n\nwill always occupy heavenly places even while we are sharing rule over the\nearth with Christ (Matt. 25:21; Luke 19:17-19). Three important arguments\nsuggest that the church saints will be equipped for both heavenly and earthly\nenvironments: (1) The saints in their resurrected state will be like the angels\n(Luke 20:35-38), and angels often ministered to humans on earth; (2) Jesus,\nafter His resurrection, appeared to His followers on earth for forty days and\n(3) at the resurrection of Jesus, \u201cmany bodies of the saints\u201d arose from their\ngraves and \u201cappeared to many\u201d (Matt. 27:52-53).\nE. Life and conditions on the millennial earth\n1. Christ\u2019s millennial reign will be characterized by universal justice and\nrighteousness (Jer. 23:5-6; Isa. 11:3-5; 52:1-16; Ps. 72:1-8).\n2. All the earth will be under the righteous discipline of King Jesus, and\nall who disobey will be disciplined (Zech. 14:16-21).\n3. There will be peace among all the nations during the millennial rule of\nChrist (Ps. 72; Isa. 2:4; 9:5-6; 32:1,17-18; Mic. 5:4-5).\n4. There will be happiness and joy in Christ\u2019s kingdom (Isa. 9:2-4; 25:6-\n9; 35:10).\n5. In Christ\u2019s kingdom, the people of the nation of Israel will enjoy health\nand longevity (Isa. 35:5-6; 65:20-22).\n6. On the millennial earth there will be great material prosperity (Ps.\n72:15-16; Amos 9:13-15; Zech. 3:10; 8:12).\n7. Under Christ\u2019s reign, the earth will be freed from the curse (Rom.\n8:19-22; Isa. 55:13; 41:18-19). With the removal of the curse, wild animals\nwill lose their ferocity (Isa. 11:6-9; 65:25; Ezek. 34:25-28; Hosea 2:18).\n\nIX. The Judgments\nAll humans will stand before the judgment of God in order that His\nrighteousness may be vindicated: \u201cAnd as it is appointed for men to die\nonce, but after this the judgment\u2026\u201d (Heb. 9:27). The psalmist declared:\n\u201cRighteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne\u2026\u201d (Ps. 89:14).\nGod\u2019s holiness and justice require that all sin be punished and that all right\nbe upheld: \u201cFar be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righ-\nteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be\nit from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\u201d (Gen. 18:25).\nThe conscience of every human witnesses to the fact that all good and evil\nare known by God and recorded in His indelible record. Paul wrote that\nGentiles \u201c\u2026show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience\nalso bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else\nexcusing them\u2026in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus\nChrist, according to my gospel\u201d (Rom. 2:15-16). All humans have sinned\n(Rom. 3:10-23); therefore, all are deserving of condemnation. The clearest\npicture of the demands of God\u2019s holiness and justice is seen in the cross. God\nis love; but to bestow His mercy on sinners, He judged and punished the sins\nof humanity through the crucifixion of His redeemer Son. The infinite Savior\nbore the guilt of sinners so that those who have faith in Jesus might be freed\nfrom condemnation (Rom. 8:1).\nSome have the erroneous idea that there will be one general day of reck-\noning when all humans just or unjust will be judged. The Bible speaks of a\nnumber of judgments. The Scofield Bible (Oxford University Press, 1967),\nin the footnotes for Revelation 20:12, lists seven, separate judgments. In the\nfollowing section these judgments will be treated under four catego-\nries: (1) the judgment of the believer, (2) the judgment of the nations, (3)\nthe judgment of the wicked dead and (4) the judgment of Satan and the\nfallen angels.\nA. The judgment of the believers\nThere are three aspects to the believer\u2019s judgment. The believer\u2019s first\njudgment took place at the cross: \u201cNow is the judgment of this world; now\nthe ruler of this world will be cast out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth,\n\nwill draw all peoples to Myself\u201d (John 12:31-32). In reality, the cross is the\njudgment of all sin and of all sinners, including Satan. At the cross believers\nplead guilty, confess their sin and identify themselves with Jesus, their sub-\nstitute and savior: \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive\nus our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). Having\nbeen judged at the cross, the faithful will not stand judgment relative to their\nsalvation, only relative to their rewards for service (John 3:18; 5:24; Rom.\n8:1-33; I Thess. 5:9). The second aspect of the believer\u2019s judgment is their\ncontinuing self-judgment. Paul wrote: \u201cFor if we would judge ourselves, we\nwould not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord,\nthat we may not be condemned with the world\u201d (1 Cor. 11:31-32). This\nchastening is part of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in the believer\u2019s\nlife (see Rom. 15:16; 1 Thess. 5:14-23; 2 Thess. 2:13; 1 John 1:7-2:2).\nThe third aspect of the believer\u2019s judgment is before the judgment seat\nof Christ. This is not a judgment of condemnation but a determination of\nthe believer\u2019s awards. This judgment of awards will take place at the second\ncoming of Christ (1 Cor. 4:5). Paul gave details concerning the believer\u2019s\njudgment in his letters to the Corinthian church:\nNow if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, sil-\nver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one\u2019s work\nwill become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it\nwill be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one\u2019s\nwork, of what sort it is. If anyone\u2019s work which he has built\non it endures, he will receive a reward. If anyone\u2019s work is\nburned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet\nso as through fire (1 Cor. 3:12-15).\nFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,\nthat each one may receive the things done in the body,\naccording to what he has done, whether good or bad\n[worthless] (2 Cor. 5:10).\nIn their life and service, all believers are building upon the foundation\nof Christ Jesus. All believers must answer before Christ\u2019s tribunal (the bema\n\njudgment) to have their individual works tested as a basis for recompense.\nThe judgment seat of Christ will reveal the service of believers to be gold,\nsilver and precious stones or hay, wood and stubble. The latter will not stand\nthe test in the crucible of Christ\u2019s glory. Believers who have built \u201cworth-\nless\u201d works on the foundation of Christ Jesus will still be saved because sal-\nvation is by faith, not by works. However, they will not receive awards or\ncrowns: \u201cLook to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for,\nbut that we may receive a full reward\u201d (2 John 8; see also 1 John 2:28; Rev.\n3:11). If believers build \u201cgood\u201d works on the foundation of Christ, they will\nreceive from the Lord reward and the proclamation of \u201cWell done, good and\nfaithful servant\u201d (Matt. 25:21).\nThe believer\u2019s special rewards are called crowns. They are four in number:\n1. The crown of rejoicing\n\u201cFor what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in\nthe presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For you are our glory\nand joy\u201d (1 Thess. 2:19-20). Paul considered his converts his crown of rejoic-\ning. Note that he expected to receive his crown at the second coming of Jesus.\nThe crown of rejoicing is the soul winner\u2019s crown.\n2. The crown of righteousness\nThis crown Paul expected to receive as a reward for his \u201cgood fight,\u201d his\n\u201cfaith kept\u201d and \u201ccourse finished\u201d (2 Tim. 4:7-8). The crown of righteousness\nis the winner\u2019s crown from the athletic metaphor:\nAnd everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in\nall things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown,\nbut we for an imperishable crown. Therefore I run thus:\nnot with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats\nthe air. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjec-\ntion, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should\nbecome disqualified (1 Cor. 9:25-27).\n\n3. The crown of life\nThe crown of life is the martyr\u2019s crown for it is promised to those who\nare faithful until death:\nDo not fear any of those things which you are about to\nsuffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into\nprison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribula-\ntion ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you\nthe crown of life (Rev. 2:10).\nThe crown of life is promised to those who live their lives prepared to endure\ntemptation, trials and death for their witness: \u201cBlessed is the man who endures\ntemptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life\nwhich the Lord has promised to those who love Him\u201d (James 1:12).\n4. The crown of glory\nThe crown of glory is for faithful pastors and elders. Peter mentioned this\ncrown while instructing the pastors and elders of the church: \u201c\u2026and when\nthe Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not\nfade away\u201d (1 Pet. 5:4). The Greek word for \u201ccrown\u201d is stephanos, which is the\nname of the crown that was awarded at Greek games. The Greeks made their\nathletic crowns out of olive or laurel that soon faded. The crown of glory,\nwhich the Lord will give to His undershepherds, will outlast the ages.\nB. The judgment of the nations\nIn Matthew 25, Jesus declares that He will gather all nations before Him to\nbe judged at the time of his coming (Matt. 25:31-46). At the end of the tribu-\nlation, before He begins His millennial reign, Jesus will separate the nations as a\nshepherd separates sheep from goats. It seems from the context the basis of judg-\nment will be the treatment rendered to His \u201cbrethren,\u201d the righteous remnant\nof Israel, who will be Christ\u2019s witnesses during the tribulation (Rev. 7; 11:1-12).\nThese will be the Gentiles who survive the tribulation and do not bow to the\n\nbeast. They will become the nations that the Old Testament prophets predicted\nwould inhabit the earth during the kingdom age (Isa. 11:10).\nC. The judgment of the wicked dead\nThe judgment of the wicked dead is known as the \u201cGreat White Throne\nJudgment\u201d (Rev. 20:11). This judgment will not take place until after the\nmillennial reign of Christ:\nThen I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on\nit, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.\nAnd there was found no place for them. And I saw the\ndead, small and great, standing before God, and books\nwere opened. And another book was opened, which is the\nBook of Life. And the dead were judged according to their\nworks, by the things which were written in the books. The\nsea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades\ndelivered up the dead who were in them. And they were\njudged, each one according to his works. Then Death and\nHades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second\ndeath (Rev. 20:11-14).\nThe judge of the wicked dead will be Christ Jesus to whom God has\nassigned all judgment (Acts 17:31). Those judged will be the wicked dead\nwho did not have part in the first resurrection, which will take place at the\ntime of the rapture of the saints (1 Thess. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52). This judgment\nwill be on the basis of works. There will be a difference in the severity of\njudgment (Matt. 10:15; Luke 10:12). However, the mildest degree of judg-\nment will still include the dreadful fate of being lost. These wicked persons\nwill have spurned every offer of God\u2019s mercy in Christ Jesus. Therefore, their\nnames are not found written in the Book of Life.\nD. The judgment of Satan and the fallen angels\nAt the end of Christ\u2019s thousand-year reign, Satan will be released from\nhis prison for a brief season. He will go forth to deceive the nations. Satan\u2019s\n\nrebellion, his last, will end with the fiery destruction of the rebels, and Satan\nwill be cast into the lake of fire forever (Rev. 20:10). Several Bible passages\nrefer to a final judgment of fallen angels (Isa. 24:21-22; 2 Pet. 2:4; Jude\n6). The judgment of fallen angels seems to occur at the same time Satan\nis judged. According to Paul, the saints will participate in the judgment of\nangels (1 Cor. 6:3).\nX. The Final Destinies\nScripture is clear that there is a final destiny for all humans beyond this\npresent life on earth: \u201cAnd these go away into everlasting punishment, but\nthe righteous into eternal life\u201d (Matt. 25:46). Jesus said of those who hear\nHis voice and follow Him, \u201c\u2026I give them eternal life, and they shall never\nperish\u2026\u201d (John 10:28). Paul wrote \u201c\u2026those who do not obey the gospel of\nour Lord Jesus Christ. These shall be punished with everlasting destruction\nfrom the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power\u2026\u201d (2 Thess.\n1:8-9). The Bible states that the righteous will enjoy everlasting life and bliss\nin the presence of the Lord, while the unrighteous will suffer everlasting pun-\nishment and separation from the Lord. The future abode of the righteous will\nbe heaven (2 Cor. 5:1, 1 Pet. 1:4). The future abode of the unrighteous will\nbe hell, gehenna (Mark 9:43-44; Rev. 20:14).\nA. The future destiny of the unrighteous\nAs mentioned previously, the King James and New King James versions\noften use the term \u201chell\u201d to translate the Hebrew word sheol and the Greek\nword hades. Other translations leave the words sheol and hades untranslated\nbecause both words can have different meanings based on usage. Both sheol\nand hades are sometimes used to designate the place of departed spirits or the\nintermediate state where the dead abide. In the New Testament \u201chell\u201d is trans-\nlated from the Greek gehenna. Gehenna was the refuse dump in the Valley of\nHinnom where fires burned unendingly. This became symbolic of the final,\neternal perdition where the fires of hell burn unendingly (Mark 9:43; Rev.\n20). The wicked are kept in hades until the final judgment when they are cast\n\ninto the lake of fire. Hell is also used to translate tartaroo, used once in the\nNew Testament to describe the place where wicked angels were cast (2 Pet.\n2:4). After the millennium all the wicked dead are resurrected. They will then\nface the Great White Throne Judgment and be cast into the lake of fire (Rev.\n19:20; 20:10-14, 15; 21:7-8). The Bible uses various descriptions to represent\nthe final condition of the wicked:\n1. Separation from God (Luke 13:25-28; 2 Thess. 1:9)\n2. Outer darkness (Matt. 22:13; 2 Pet. 2:4-17; Jude 6-13)\n3. Eternal, everlasting, unquenchable fire (Matt. 18:8; Mark 9:43,45,48;\n2 Pet. 3:7; Jude 7)\n4. Everlasting contempt (Dan. 12:2)\n5. Everlasting torment (Rev. 14:10-11)\n6. Everlasting punishment (Matt. 25:46)\n7. Everlasting destruction or perdition (2 Thess. 1:8-9; Phil. 3:18-19;\nMatt. 7:13; Rom. 9:22; 2 Pet. 3:7)\n8. Where the worm does not die (Mark 9:44)\n9. The wrath of God (Rom. 2:5,8,9; 1 Thess. 1:10)\n10. Retribution; punishment proportionate to the evil (2 Cor. 11:14-15;\n2 Tim. 4:14; Rev. 18:6; 22:12)\n11. The second death (Rev. 20:14; 21:8)\n\nB. Theories that deny the unending punishment of the wicked\n1. Annihilationism\nAccording to the theory of annihilationism, the wicked are punished for\nan age and then are annihilated. Annihilationists contend that the Greek word\naionios derived from aion, meaning \u201cage,\u201d has the meaning of \u201cage long\u201d rather\nthan \u201ceverlasting.\u201d Therefore, they believe there is a period of torment for the\nwicked that will come to an end. However, aionios is the strongest word in the\nGreek language to express the idea of endlessness. Furthermore, aionios is the\nword used to express the \u201ceternity\u201d of God, of the Holy Spirit and of the life of\nthe believer. Following the reasoning of the annihilationist, if punishment of\nthe wicked is only an age long, then the life of God and of the believer is only\nan age long. In Matthew 25:46, the punishment of the unrighteous and the\nlife of the righteous are expressed by the same word, aionios. At the beginning\nof the thousand years, the beast and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire.\nAt the end of the thousand years, Satan is cast into the same lake of fire: \u201c\u2026\nwhere the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and\nnight forever and ever [literally into the ages of the ages]\u201d (Rev. 20:10). After\nthe beast and false prophet spend the millennial age in perdition, they will share\nSatan\u2019s doom \u201cinto the ages of the ages.\u201d This passage demonstrates that their\npunishment is obviously more than an \u201cage long.\u201d\n2. Universalism\nUniversalists believe that all people will be saved. Some universalists even\nbelieve that Satan and the fallen angels will be saved. According to various\nuniversalist theories, either the punishment or the love of God will bring\nabout a change of heart on the part of the wicked, and all will receive the sal-\nvation of Christ. Scripture does not teach this doctrine. Scripture states that\nafter a millennium in the abyss, Satan will be released and immediately lead\na rebellion against God and His saints. A thousand years of imprisonment\ndoes not change or turn the Deceiver to God. The beast and false prophet\ndo not change after a millennium in the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20, 20:10). The\nrich man in Hades found a great gulf fixed between himself and Abraham\u2019s\nbosom. He pleaded for a messenger from the realms of the dead to warn his\n\nbrothers of the dangers of hell; however, he was told that if they have rejected\nthe law and the prophets, no messenger from the dead will be able to avert\ntheir same destruction (Luke 16:22-31).\nHowever frightening the prospect of eternal perdition may seem, we may\nbe certain that God\u2019s righteous judgment will be vindicated. We know that\nGod\u2019s judgment will be right and just because of the great extent to which\nGod demonstrated His love by sending His Son to die for us. The grace and\nlove of God are beyond measure. If there had been a way for humans to be\nsaved without the ordeal of the cross, God would not have subjected His Son\nto crucifixion. The cross demonstrates not only the love and mercy of God\nbut also the sinfulness of sin. The wicked are consigned to hell only after a\njudgment in which the books are opened and just sentences are pronounced.\nThe severity of perdition will not be the same for all. The punishments of the\nwicked will vary in severity, just as the rewards of the righteous will differ in\nglory (Luke 12:47-48; 1 Cor. 3:12-15). In the light of eternity, every person\u2019s\nconscience will witness to the \u201crightness\u201d of God\u2019s final judgments.\nC. The final destiny of Satan, the fallen angels and the Antichrist\nThe final destiny of Satan, the wicked angels and the Antichrist has already\nbeen treated under the sections on their judgment and the final destiny of the\nwicked. Ultimately, they will be cast into the lake of fire where \u201c\u2026they will be\ntormented day and night forever and ever\u201d (Rev. 20:10; see also Matt. 25:41;\nJude 6; 2 Pet. 2:4; Rev. 19:20; 20:1-3, 10; Isa. 14:14-15; 24:21).\nD. The future state of the righteous\nThe eternal state of the believer is life through and with the Lord Jesus\nChrist: \u201cAnd this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this\nlife is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of\nGod does not have life\u201d (1 John 5:11-12). Eternal life is not merely eternal exis-\ntence. All humans, righteous and unrighteous, will exist eternally. Eternal \u201clife\u201d\nrefers not merely to the duration of life but to the quality of life. Believers have\nChrist\u2019s life (Gal. 2:20) because they have Christ within them (Col. 1:27). Life\nin Christ is the present possession of believers as well as their future hope. Life\n\nin Christ is spoken of as the future state of the believer only in the sense that\nwhen Christ comes, eternal life is beyond forfeiture (1 John 3:2; Rev. 2:10).\nWhether in Paradise, reigning with Christ in His millennial kingdom or\ninhabiting the New Jerusalem, the believer will abide in the presence of Jesus in\nHis Father\u2019s house. Life in the Father\u2019s house is assured by the promise of Christ\nto prepare a place for us there (John 14:2-3). The preparation that made a place\nfor us in the Father\u2019s house is the atoning work of Christ on the cross of Calvary.\nThe eternal abode of the believer is a home in heaven with God. The Scripture\nuses many glorious words to describe the place Jesus has prepared for us:\n1. Heaven is the place where Jesus our Savior abides (John 14:2-3; Acts\n7:56; Luke 1:2; 2 Cor. 5:2; Phil. 1:23).\n2. Heaven is an ample place: \u201cIn My Father\u2019s house are many mansions\n[abiding places]\u201d (John 14:2-3).\n3. Heaven is a better place (Heb. 10:34; 11:16).\n4. Heaven is a perfect place: \u201cYour kingdom come. Your will be done On\nearth as it is in heaven\u201d (Matt. 6:10).\n5. Heaven is a place of inheritance where believers will receive an inheri-\ntance because they are joint heirs with Christ (1 Pet. 1:4; Rom. 8:17).\n6. Heaven is a place of reward (Matt. 5:12; 6:20; 19:21; Luke 12:33; Col.\n1:5; 2 Tim. 4:8).\n7. Heaven is a place of praise (Rev. 19:1).\n8. Heaven is a place of beauty, splendor and glory (Rev. 21, 22).\n9. Heaven is a joyful place (Rev. 21:4; Matt. 25:21-23; Luke 15:7-10;\nHeb. 12:2).\n\n10. Heaven is a place of personal identity.\nAfter death, the rich man and Lazarus retained their personal identities.\nMoses and Elijah were still identifiable when they appeared to Jesus on the\nMount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:2-3). After the resurrection, Jesus was\nrecognized by His followers. Our names are written in the Book of Life, and\nnames signify identity and personality (Phil. 4:3). The fact that believers will\nhave their resurrected bodies in heaven demonstrates that God\u2019s redeeming\nwork extends to the total person. We will not lose personal identity in heaven;\non the contrary, our personalities will be raised to the highest level of personal\nbeing. The best of earth\u2019s relationships in the body of Christ will endure in\nheavenly life.\n\u201cI, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify\nto you these things in the churches.\nI am the Root and the Offspring of\nDavid, the Bright and Morning Star.\u201d\nAnd the Spirit and the bride say,\n\u201cCome!\u201d\nAnd let him who hears say, \u201cCome!\u201d\nAnd let him who thirsts come.\nWhosoever desires, let him take the\nwater of life freely\u2026\nHe who testifies to these things says,\n\u201cSurely I am coming quickly.\u201d\nAmen.\nEven so, come, Lord Jesus! (Rev. 22:16-17, 20).\n\n"};
