We must carefully study the doctrine of the\nchurch to fully understand the church\u2019s purpose in the world. Spirit-filled\nworship and ministry is vital in healthy churches. Therefore, every Christian\nshould seek a clear understanding of New Testament Pentecostal church life,\nministry and leadership. Since the church is the divinely constituted body\nthrough which the gospel is preached and believers are nurtured, a careful\nstudy and clear understanding of the church is essential. The best place to\nbegin such a study is with definitions.\nI. Definitions of Church\nA. Kuriakos\nThe English word church is derived from the Greek word kuriakos which\nmeans \u201cbelonging to the Lord.\u201d Kuriakos is never applied to the church in the\n\nNew Testament period although it is found twice in the New Testament as an\nadjective applying to the Lord\u2019s Supper and to the Lord\u2019s Day (1 Cor. 11:20;\nRev. 1:10). In post-apostolic times, the Greeks used the term kuriakos to des-\nignate the church building. However, the only words in the New Testament\nused to designate a building as a place of worship are temple and assem-\nbly (Acts 5:42; James 2:2). Kuriakos evolved into the English word church\nthrough kirk, the Scottish and Northern English form of the word church.\nB. Ekklesia\nIn the English New Testament, the word church is used invariably to\ntranslate the Greek word ekklesia (Matt. 16:18; 18:17; Acts 2:47; 9:31; 13:1;\n14:23; 15:22; 16:5; 20:17, 28; Rom. 16:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 5:23-29;\nCol. 1:18; Rev. 1:4, 11). The word ekklesia means \u201can assembly of people.\u201d\nThe term is derived from two Greek words, ek meaning \u201cout from\u201d and kaleo\nmeaning \u201cto call.\u201d Originally, \u201cthe ones called out\u201d referred to the legislative\nbody of the Greek republic that was led by citizens called out from their com-\nmunities to serve their country. Today when we refer to a session of a state\ngovernment as an assembly, we are using the word assembly in the same way\nthe Greeks used the term ekklesia.\nWhen Jesus used the word ekklesia to designate the body He would build,\nthe word derived meaning from at least two sources: (1) the Jewish Greek Old\nTestament (Septuagint) where ekklesia referred to the congregation of Israel\nand (2) the Greek use of the word to refer to any assembly of people, whether\na constituted body or an unorganized mob. An example of the Jewish use is\nfound in Acts 7:37-38: \u201cThis is that Moses\u2026who was in the congregation\nin the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and\nwith our fathers, the one who received the living oracles to give to us\u2026\u201d\nThe Septuagint usually used the word ekklesia to translate the Hebrew word\nquahal, which was the Old Testament word for the congregation of Israel in\nthe wilderness. Examples of the Greek use of ekklesia are found in Acts 19:\n\u201cSome therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly [ekklesia\nas mob] was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come\ntogether\u201d (v. 32); and \u201cBut if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall\n\nbe determined in the lawful assembly [ekklesia as official legislative body]\u201d\n(v. 39).\nIt seems clear that Jesus chose the word ekklesia because it had been used\nto designate God\u2019s people, but the word in the popular mind merely meant\nassembly. The Septuagint also sometimes translates the Hebrew word quahal\nusing the word synagogue. The word ekklesia may have been used to avoid\nconfusion of the church with the synagogue of Israel. When Jesus said, \u201cand\non this rock I will build My church\u2026\u201d (Matt. 16:18), He placed emphasis\nnot on the word church but on the word My. The church is unique, not\nbecause it is called the church but because it is the assembly of believers who\nbelong to Jesus, who constitute His body.\nII. Uses of the Term \u201cChurch\u201d in the New Testament\nA. The universal body of Christ\nThe universal church is composed of all Christian believers of all ages,\nboth on earth and in paradise, the total body of Christ. The total universal\nchurch will be assembled at the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:6-9)\nfollowing the rapture of the church. There are many scriptures that speak of\nthe universal church: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 3:10-21; 5:23-32; Col. 1:18, 24. The\nauthor of Hebrews spoke of the universal church when he wrote, \u201cBut you\nhave come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly\nJerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and\nchurch of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all,\nto the spirits of just men made perfect\u2026\u201d (Heb. 12:22-24).\nB. The local church\nThe local church is composed of Christian believers identified with a\nconstituted body worshiping in one locality (Rom. 16:1; Col. 4:16; Gal. 1:2,\n22; Acts 14:23). The members of a local church constitute the church even\nwhen they are not assembled. This fact is expressed in Acts: \u201cNow when they\nhad come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had\n\ndone with them\u2026\u201d (14:27). All genuine believers are members of the univer-\nsal body of Christ. However, if possible, all faithful believers are to be identi-\nfied with a local church where they regularly assemble for worship, fellowship\nand service (Heb. 10:24-25). Christianity is about more than a person\u2019s indi-\nvidual salvation, for believers are also disciples, brethren and members of a\nbody. This truth is expressed in the Foursquare Declaration of Faith:\nWe believe that having accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as\npersonal Savior and King, and having thus been born into\nthe family and invisible body or church of the Lord, it is\nthe sacred duty of the believer, whenever this lieth within\nhis power, to identify himself with, and I labor most\nearnestly for the upbuilding of God\u2019s kingdom with the\nvisible church of Christ upon earth\u2026(James 5:14; Acts\n11:26-30).4\nC. The house church\nIn New Testament times there were no church buildings; believers met\nfor worship wherever facilities were made available to them. Often they met\nin the homes of fellow believers: \u201cAquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in\nthe Lord, with the church that is in their house\u201d (1 Cor. 16:19b). When\nthe church in a given community was very large, there were many house\nchurches (see 1 Cor. 14:23). However, the many house churches in that\ncommunity were collectively still considered one church, and they all came\ntogether as often as possible. In small communities, one house church may\nhave accommodated the entire body of believers (see Col. 4:15). One reason\nchurches usually had a plurality of elders was perhaps that there were several\nhouse churches within the total body of the community. The apostle Paul\ncalled together the elders of the church in Ephesus: \u201cFrom Miletus he sent to\nEphesus and called for the elders of the church\u201d (Acts 20:17). Although the\nchurch in Ephesus was one, the large number of elders (pastors) suggests that\nthe church often met in homes because of the lack of large church buildings.\n4 Aimee Semple McPherson, Declaration of Faith (International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, n.d.) 22.\n\nEven so, all of these house churches in Ephesus were considered to be part of\none church: \u201cTherefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among\nwhich the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God\nwhich He purchased with His own blood\u201d (Acts 20:28). Every local church\nwas considered to be the physical manifestation of the universal church in\nthat community (see also Rom. 16:5-23; 1 Cor. 16:19; Philem. 2).\nD. The collective church\nThere are several New Testament passages that refer to the visible church\non earth as one church (1 Cor. 10:32; 15:9; Gal. 1:13; Phil. 3:6). In Acts 9:31\nthe New King James Version uses the plural word \u201cchurches\u201d to reference the\npeace that the collective church experienced after Saul\u2019s conversion. However,\nin the Greek text, the word for \u201cchurch\u201d is actually singular rather than plural\nand is translated that way in other versions: \u201cSo the church throughout all\nJudea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was built up; and walking in\nthe fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied\u201d\n(Acts 9:31, RSV). In other passages, the word \u201cchurch\u201d is used generically,\nthat is, referring to the church generally (see Matt. 18:17; 1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Cor.\n12:28).\nE. The churches acting in concert\nThere are those who contend that local churches were autonomous, sub-\nject only to local leadership that was selected by the vote of each local con-\ngregation. There is no doubt that local churches had much liberty; they were\nnot ruled rigidly by a central hierarchy, a fact demonstrated by the council on\ndoctrine and practice recorded in Acts Chapter Fifteen. However, a number\nof Scripture passages make it clear that the churches acted in concert and fol-\nlowed apostolic leadership (see Acts 14:23; Rom. 16:4; 1 Cor. 16:19; 14:33;\n2 Cor. 11:28; Titus 1:5). Paul instructed local churches on doctrine, prac-\ntice and government; he sent greetings on behalf of groups of churches in a\nregion; he appointed elders over churches as well as instructed fellow workers\nto appoint officers. Paul wrote to Titus ordering: \u201cFor this reason I left you\nin Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint\nelders in every city as I commanded you\u2026\u201d (Titus 1:5).\n\nIII. Uses of the Word \u201cChurch\u201d Not Found in the New\nTestament\nA. Church is not used to describe a building\nThe Greek word ekklesia, which is translated \u201cchurch,\u201d always refers to\npeople; it never refers to a building. Today, individuals often use the word\nchurch to refer to buildings. The Bible used the word church to refer to peo-\nple. For instance, when the Bible speaks of the church at Ephesus, it is refer-\nencing the congregation of Christian believers at Ephesus. Since no church\nbuildings were built until the third century, no words were coined to refer to\none. When church buildings were eventually built, the word kuriake, mean-\ning \u201cthe Lord\u2019s house,\u201d was used to refer to them. It is an understandable nat-\nural development that the word church eventually became a description for\nboth congregations and the buildings where congregations meet. Calling the\nbuilding a church is a figure of speech called a \u201cmetonymy.\u201d A metonymy is\nwhen a concept or thing is referred to not by its own name but by something\nassociated in meaning with that concept or thing. One kind of metonymy\nis when something is not mentioned by its name but by its container. For\nexample, in 1 Corinthians 11:26 when Paul wrote, \u201cFor as often as you\u2026\ndrink this cup\u2026\u201d he was not telling people to drink the cup, but to drink\nwhat is inside the cup. The cup represents both the container and the drink\nin the same way the word church represents both the building and the con-\ngregation. No harm is done in calling the sanctuary a church as long as one\nkeeps in mind the real nature of the church.\nB. Church is not used for a denomination\nDuring New Testament times, no groups of Christians arose with separate\nname identities similar to modern denominations. Therefore, the word church\ndid not come to be formally appended to the names of leaders, doctrinal tenets\nor distinct ecclesiastical organizations such as the Lutheran Church or Baptist\nChurch. The ideal condition for the church on earth would most likely have\nbeen one of universal unity in doctrine and organization. However, denom-\ninations have formed for many reasons. For instance, throughout history\nwhenever ecclesiastical bodies have departed from Scripture in doctrine and\n\npractice, there have been reformations rejected by the parent denomination,\nforcing the formation of other distinct bodies. Leadership conflicts and divi-\nsiveness have also led pastors and churches to leave their theological traditions\nto form new organizational expressions. Widespread revival has often faced\nnegative reaction from established church leadership. This resistance to revival\nhas lead to the formation of organizations to preserve doctrinal soundness and\nspiritual life. Sadly, some churches have abandoned their denominations over\npetty disputes and disagreements.\nThe ecumenical movement has endeavored to bring denominations\nto a corporate reunion. This has had mixed results. Sometimes ecumenical\nunity has been accomplished at the expense of doctrinal and spiritual full-\nness. Finding a faith and practice acceptable to all sometimes leads to uniting\naround the \u201cleast common denominator.\u201d However, at other times various\ndenominations have been able to unite in meaningful ways around the foun-\ndational tenants of the gospel to have a powerful evangelistic impact in the\nworld. The formation of denominations may have been necessary to preserve\nrevival and missionary fervor. Regardless, the members of denominational\nchurches must keep in mind that the church, which is the body of Christ, is\ncomposed of all true believers, and all true believers must be united in Christ\nto carry forward the gospel into the world. It is certainly a biblical truth that\nlocal churches should band together whenever possible for mission and fel-\nlowship (2 Cor. 8:1-24; Titus 1:5).\nIV. The Officers, Ministers and Leaders of the Church\nThe amount of scriptural material relative to the organization and lead-\nership of the apostolic church is not large. The titles used by New Testament\nchurch leaders were more descriptive of their ministries than of their office\nand rank. Since the first members and leaders of the early church were Jews\nfamiliar with the synagogue, they patterned church organization somewhat\nafter the synagogue. In fact, in one New Testament passage in the Greek, the\nChristian assembly is called a synagogue (James 2:2).\n\nThat there was organization in the New Testament church is clearly seen\nfrom the following scriptures:\n(1) When problems arose, leaders were appointed to administer certain\nministry activities (Acts 6:1-7).\n(2) The disciples met regularly for worship; at first, they met every day;\nlater, they met on the first day of the week (Acts 2:46-47; 5:42; 20:7; 1 Cor.\n16:2).\n(3) Diligence was given to the appointment of proper leadership (Acts\n1:23-26; 14:23; Titus 1:5).\n(4) Qualifications for elders (bishops) and deacons were set forth in\nsome detail (1 Tim. 3:1-13; 5:1, 17-22; Titus 1:5-9; 1 Pet. 5:1-4; Acts 6:1-7;\n20:28-35).\n(5) Each church had the authority to discipline or exclude certain mem-\nbers (Matt. 18:17; 1 Cor. 5:1-5; 2 Thess. 3:6-16; 1 Tim. 1:18-20).\n(6) Members were admonished to respect and obey church leaders\n(1 Thess. 5:12-13; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24).\n(7) Missionaries were sent forth by the church with official sanction (Acts\n13:1-3).\n(8) A council was convened in Jerusalem to settle for the whole Christian\nchurch a dispute over doctrine and practice (Acts 15:1-35).\nIt is not easy to classify the various ministers and officers mentioned in\nthe New Testament. Several terms such as pastor, elder and bishop, which we\ntake for titles, are probably different ways of describing the same function.\nSome terms like minister and deacon are different translations of the same\nGreek word diakonos. Some offices such as apostle and prophet are strictly\n\nby divine appointment of the exercise of a spiritual gift, while other offices\nare by human election or appointment based upon specified qualifications.\nPastors and teachers may be two kinds of ministers, or the terms may simply\nrepresent two functions of one office. In spite of the difficulties involved, we\nwill now analyze each New Testament office.\nA. Apostles\nThe first exponents of the Christian gospel were the apostles, who were\nalso God\u2019s first ministry gift to the church. The following are scriptures that\nspeak to the role of apostles in the church:\nAnd when it was day, He called His disciples to Himself;\nand from them He chose twelve whom He also named\napostles\u2026(Luke 6:13).\nAnd as they went through the cities, they delivered to\nthem the decrees to keep, which were determined by the\napostles and elders at Jerusalem (Acts 16:4).\nAnd He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets,\nsome evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the\nequipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ\u2026(Eph. 4:11-12).\nNow, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreign-\ners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the\nhousehold of God, having been built on the foundation of\nthe apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the\nchief cornerstone\u2026(Eph. 2:19-20).\nThe word apostle is a transliteration of the Greek word apostolos, which\nmeans \u201ca messenger\u201d or \u201cone sent on a mission.\u201d The original apostles were\nthose Jesus chose to be with Him, personally commissioned and sent forth\n(Matt. 10:2; Luke 22:14). They were twelve in number. When Judas Iscariot\n\nbetrayed the Lord, leaving only eleven, another apostle was chosen to take\nhis place (Acts. 1:15-26). The names of the twelve apostles are written in the\ntwelve foundations of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14).\nThe requirements for the first apostles were (1) to have been with the\nLord (Acts 1:21-22); (2) to have been a witness of the resurrection (Acts\n1:22); (3) to have seen the Lord (1 Cor. 9:1), and (4) to have demonstrated\nsigns, wonders and mighty deeds (2 Cor. 12:12). The foundational apostles\nwere a fixed number of twelve.\nHowever, in time others were called apostles, such as (1) Paul, who was\ngiven a vision of the Lord and called personally by Jesus to be the apostle to\nthe Gentiles (Rom. 11:13; 1 Cor. 9:1), who twelve times declared himself to\nbe an apostle; (2) James, the brother of Jesus (1 Cor. 15:7); (3) Barnabas (Acts\n14:14); (4) certain kinsmen of Paul (Rom. 16:7), and (5) certain unnamed\napostles (1 Cor. 15:7). Apparently, the term apostle came to be used in a\nwider sense for those who seemed to have a special commission to found new\nchurches. The terms apostle and missionary have the same meaning. That the\nterm apostle was used in a wider sense than just referring to the original twelve\nis obvious from the fact that there were those who falsely claimed to be apos-\ntles (2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2). If only the original twelve had been recognized\nas apostles, no one else could have made a claim to apostleship. It is import-\nant to keep clear the distinction between the original apostles and those who\nwere called apostles in the wider meaning of the term. Closely identified with\nthe original twelve apostles were Paul, Mark, Luke, James, Jude and the writer\nof Hebrews; all were used by the Spirit to write the New Testament.\nDiscussion often arises concerning whether or not there could be modern\napostles. The answer depends upon the meaning given to the word apostle.\nObviously, the church can have only one foundation. After the close of the\nNew Testament Canon, no additional apostolic writers have been commis-\nsioned to add to Scripture. However, if the term apostle is used in the wider\nsense of one commissioned of the Lord to open new mission fields, whose\nministry is accompanied with signs and wonders, it would not be an inappro-\npriate use of the word. Even so, it is important to remember that the church\n\nwas never authorized to create apostles. Apostles are a gift from God, com-\nmissioned by Him and confirmed by the church (Acts 13:2-3).\nB. Prophets\nProphet is a transliteration from the Greek prophetes, derived from pro\nmeaning \u201cbefore, forth, for or in behalf of,\u201d and phemi meaning to \u201cdeclare\nor speak.\u201d Therefore, prophetes can have the meaning of one who predicts or\ntells beforehand, one who speaks forth, or one who speak for and in behalf\nof. The Hebrew word for prophet is nabi meaning \u201cto announce, witness or\ntestify.\u201d Prophets in the Old Testament were called to speak to God\u2019s people\nthe words God placed in their mouths (Deut. 18:18). In the New Testament,\nthere are two kinds of prophets: those who occupy the role of a prophet (Eph.\n4:11) and those who exercise the gift of prophecy. The message of Pentecost\ndeclares that the ability to prophesy is in some manner available to all Spirit-\nfilled believers: \u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days says God, That I\nwill pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall\nprophesy\u2026I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy\u201d\n(Acts 2:17-18). However, having the gift of prophecy does not necessarily\nmean someone occupies the ministry office of a prophet.\nScripture says the church is built upon a foundation of apostles and\nprophets (Eph. 2:20): \u201cAnd He Himself gave some to be apostles, some\nprophets\u2026\u201d (Eph. 4:11). In the New Testament, prophets not only exercised\nthe gift of prophecy but also occupied a place of ministry leadership along\nwith the apostles and teachers (Acts 11:27; 13:1-3; 15:32; Eph. 2:20; 3:5).\nIndividuals such as Barnabas, Silas, Judas, Agabus and others mentioned in\nActs 13:1 all demonstrated leadership in their prophetic roles. Although the\nprophets had great ministry authority and were next in rank to the apostles,\nthey were still subject to the apostles (1 Cor. 14:37).\nAlong with valuing the role of the prophet, Paul seemed to give the gift\nof prophecy the highest priority among the spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 14:1-3).\nAnyone prophesying is ultimately called to communicate to the people the\nmessage or vision they have received from God. The general purpose of proph-\necy is explained by Paul in the following way: \u201cBut he who prophesies speaks\n\nedification and exhortation and comfort to men. He\u2026who prophesies edifies\nthe church\u201d (1 Cor. 14:3-4). This is demonstrated in Acts: \u201cNow Judas and\nSilas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren\nwith many words\u201d (15:32). A less frequent function of the prophet and proph-\necy is that of predicting the future. On two occasions, the prophet Agabus pre-\ndicted future events (Acts 11:27-29). His prediction of a future famine enabled\nthe church to make preparation to assist the poor in Judaea. Later, Agabus\npredicted Paul\u2019s imprisonment by the Jews in Jerusalem. This prediction came\nto pass although Paul made no attempt to avoid the trouble (Acts 21:10-15).\nBoth the role of the prophet and the role of prophecy had a vital function\nin the New Testament church. Prophecy was crucial in relation to Timothy\u2019s\nenablement for ministry (1 Tim. 4:14). Even the church\u2019s awareness of God\u2019s\nplan of salvation was revealed through the ministry of the prophets: \u201c\u2026which\nwas not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now\nbeen revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit\u201d (Eph. 3:5). The\nrole of the prophet and the gift of prophecy remain in effect in the church\ntoday. In Pentecostal ministry, the spirit of prophecy has a vital role in reveal-\ning the will of God to His people.\nC. Evangelists\nThe evangelist is less easy to identify in the New Testament because\nalmost everyone did the work of evangelism. Philip is the only one actually\ncalled an evangelist (Acts 21:8). Judging from Philip\u2019s ministry in Samaria,\nan evangelist is one whose ministry is directed primarily toward winning the\nunsaved: \u201cThen Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ\nto them\u201d (Acts 8:5). It is noteworthy that his soul winning ministry was\naccompanied by miracles and signs. Afterward, Philip was called to preach\nto one man in the desert, the Ethiopian treasurer, whom he led to Christ.\nIt is interesting to note that as much space is taken to tell of the one man\u2019s\nconversion as is taken to narrate the Samaritan revival story. Timothy is not\ncalled an evangelist, but Paul admonishes him to do the work of an evangelist\n(2 Tim. 4:5). In the Greek, the word evangelist is derived from the verb that is\ntranslated \u201cto preach the gospel.\u201d This means an evangelist is one whose chief\ngoal is to preach the gospel with the object of soul winning.\n\nThe ministries of apostle, prophet and evangelist are ministries to the\nchurch in general. The ministries that follow are to the local church.\nD. Pastors\nWhile the term pastor is only used once in the New Testament to\ndescribe the spiritual leader of the local church (Eph. 4:11), it will be exam-\nined fully here for two reasons: (1) It is the term most commonly used in the\nchurch today, and (2) the pastoral metaphor is employed in several passages\n(1 Pet. 5:2-4; Acts 20:28-29; John 10:1-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Peter\n2:25; Mark 6:34; 1 Cor. 9:6-7). The favorite terminology of Jesus to express\nHis relationship to the people was that of shepherd and sheep. It is natural,\ntherefore, that those entrusted with the care of the Lord\u2019s flock should be\ncalled pastors.\nIt is difficult for people of the Western world to understand the close,\ntrusting relationship that existed between the Palestinian shepherd and his\nsheep. The word pastor expresses the loving care and mutual reliance that\nshould exist between spiritual leaders and the congregations they tend.\nOther synonyms for the pastoral office are used more frequently in the New\nTestament, but the title that has persisted in the modern church is that\nof pastor.\nE. Teachers\nTeachers are the fifth category of ministry gifts bestowed upon the church\nby the ascended Lord (Eph. 4:11). It is not absolutely clear whether the term\nteacher represents a distinct office or merely a function of apostles and pas-\ntors (elders). That teacher is a distinct ministry is indicated by the fact that\nthere were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch (Acts 13:1) and\nthat teachers are listed along with apostles and prophets as offices God has set\nin the church (1 Cor. 12:2). On the other hand, in Ephesians 4:11, teacher\nis not preceded by a definite article as are the other offices; therefore, the\nterm may merely indicate teacher as a function of pastors (pastor-teachers).\nTeaching is listed as a spiritual gift in Romans 12:6-7; therefore, it might be\nexercised by any believer who is so gifted. Paul refers to himself as one\n\n\u201c\u2026appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles\u201d (2 Tim.\n1:11). Paul admonished Timothy, a pastor, to exercise a teaching ministry (2\nTim. 2:2). The Great Commission strongly implies that teaching is of pri-\nmary importance in the ongoing work of the church: \u201cGo therefore and make\ndisciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of\nthe Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have\ncommanded you\u201d (Matt. 28:19-20). Although teaching was a part of nearly\nall of the New Testament ministries, there were those whose primary calling\nwas that of teaching the Word of God. Undoubtedly, there are those today\nwhose ministry could be best identified as that of a teacher.\nF. Elders (presbyters)\nElder was a title borrowed from the synagogue and from the congrega-\ntion of Israel. The term is used in the New Testament about 30 times with\nreference to the elders of Israel. The Hebrew word for elder is zaquen, which\nmeans \u201can older man.\u201d The Greek word presbuteros has the same meaning and\nis the source of our word \u201cpresbyter.\u201d When Paul had founded a number of\nchurches in Asia, he appointed elders to be in charge of them (Acts 14:23).\nThe elder was equivalent to the pastor and was the most common title for the\nperson in charge of a local church (Acts 20:17, 28; Titus 1:5; 1 Peter 5:1-4).\nThe elders were supported by their congregations, which were exhorted by\nthe apostle Paul to grant double honor (a suitable level of financial or other\nforms of material support) to the elders who ruled (governed or directed)\nwell their churches, and especially to those elders who devoted their time to\npreaching and teaching (1 Tim. 5:17-19).\nSince the Greek word elders is usually plural, each church most likely had\nseveral elders. This is probably because larger congregations had to meet in\nmany different house churches at the same time (1 Cor. 11:20; 16:15, 19).\nConsequently, more elders would be needed to lead the various house gath-\nerings. Some have reasoned from 1 Timothy 5:17 that there were both ruling\nelders and teaching elders. Regardless, the elders were individuals of faith and\nspiritual power for the sick were directed to seek them out for anointing with oil\nand the prayer of faith: \u201cIs anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of\nthe church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of\n\nthe Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him\nup. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven\u201d (James 5:14-15).\nG. Bishops (overseers)\nThe New King James Version frequently translates the Greek word epis-\ncopos, from which is derived our word \u201cepiscopal,\u201d with the word \u201cbishop.\u201d\nA better translation of the word would have been overseer, which is the literal\nmeaning of episcopos. The Church of England\u2019s influence can be seen in the\nchoice of the word bishop. In the New Testament, bishop and elder are names\nfor the same office as can be seen clearly by comparing Titus 1:5-6 with 1:7-9\nand Acts 20:17 with 20:28. In the Titus passage, episcopos is translated bishop,\nwhile in the Acts passage it is translated overseer. In both the Titus and Acts\npassages, bishop, overseers and elders are used interchangeably to describe\nthe same position. In New Testament times, the bishop or overseer was over\none church; it was not until the second century that the position of bishop\nwas developed to oversee several churches. After the passing of the original\napostles, the rapid growth of the church required more extensive organization\n(see also 1 Tim. 3:1-9 where the qualifications for the office of the bishop/\noverseer/elder/pastor are set forth).\nH. Deacons\nThe Bible makes it quite clear that the two set offices of the local church\nwere those of the elder and the deacon. Deacons are mentioned directly in\nonly two passages (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8-13). However, rather detailed quali-\nfications for deacons are set forth in the same chapter where the qualifications\nfor overseers are given. The word deacon is from the Greek word diakonos,\nmeaning servant. The first deacons were probably the seven individuals who\nwere chosen by the apostles to serve tables and administer the charities to the\nwidows of the Jerusalem church (Acts 6). They are not called deacons in the\nActs passage, but the verb form of the word deacon is found in the clause:\n\u201c\u2026their widows were neglected in the daily distribution [diakonia]\u201d (Acts\n6:1). The deacons served the church through managing this \u201cdaily distribu-\ntion,\u201d freeing the elders for prayer and the ministry of the word. The scrip-\ntures do not delineate the duties of deacons in the New Testament church,\n\nbut from the context of Scripture it is assumed that their duties involved the\nmanagement of the serving ministries, charities and business affairs of the\nchurches. It is important to realize that Philip and Stephen, two of the seven\ndeacons mentioned in Acts, were also preachers, so it should not be assumed\nthat deacons performed only menial tasks.\nI. Ministers\nThe word minister comes from the same Greek word that is translated\ndeacon. However, there are a number of passages where the word diakonos\ndoes not refer to the office of the deacon. For instance, Paul, writing to the\nCorinthians, said: \u201cWho then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers [dia-\nkonos] through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one?\u201d (1 Cor.\n3:5). To the Ephesian church Paul wrote, \u201c\u2026of which I became a minister\n[diakonos] according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effec-\ntive working of His power\u201d (Eph. 3:7). Paul refers to himself as a minister five\ntimes and several times refers to his younger workers as ministers. The term\napparently emphasizes the servanthood role of the preacher. The goal of the\nspiritual leaders is that of equipping the saints for ministry (Eph. 4:12). All\nsaints are expected to minister (verb), but the title minister (noun) is in every\ncase used only of those called to spiritual leadership. When the pastor is called\nthe minister, the title is being used in an appropriate, scriptural way.\nJ. Leaders (rulers)\nThe words rule and ruler are used several times in the New King James\nVersion to designate church leaders (1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24). The New\nAmerican Standard Version employs the words lead and leader, which seem\nmore appropriate. \u201cRemember those who led you, who spoke the word of God\nto you\u2026Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your\nsouls as those who will give account\u2026Greet all of your leaders and all the saints\u201d\n(Heb. 13:7, 17, 24, NASB). There are some who are prone to depreciate lead-\nership in the church. Even so, duly constituted and recognized leadership is a\nbiblical teaching and principle: \u201cAnd we urge you, brethren, to recognize those\nwho labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and\nto esteem them very highly in love for their work\u2019s sake\u201d (1 Thess. 5:12-13a).\n\nV. The Mission of the Church\nA. Preaching and teaching\nThe primary mission of the church is declared in the Great Commission,\nwhich Jesus gave to the apostles before His ascension. A form of the Great\nCommission is found in all four Gospels and in the book of Acts with each\nwriter reporting only a selected part of the total commission. Therefore, it\nwill be necessary to examine all five occurrences of Jesus\u2019 charge to the church\nto grasp the full scope of the commission.\nMark emphasizes the church\u2019s mission to preach the gospel: \u201cAnd He\nsaid to them, \u2018Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\u2019\u201d\n(Mark 16:15). The importance of preaching may be indicated by the fact\nthat the words for preaching are found more than 115 times in the New\nTestament. There are two principal Greek words translated \u201cto preach\u201d:\n(1) kerusso which means \u201cto herald\u201d as a royal proclamation and (2) euangelizo\nwhich means \u201cto preach the good news.\u201d Both of these words occur more\nthan 50 times in the New Testament. In addition to focusing on preaching\nas a mission of the church, Mark also focuses on the supernatural power of\nthe Holy Spirit that Jesus promised would accompany the preaching of the\ngospel (Mark 16:17-20).\nThe part of the Great Commission reported in Luke\u2019s gospel also empha-\nsizes preaching: \u201c\u2026and that repentance and remission of sins should be\npreached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are\nwitnesses of these things. Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you;\nbut tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on\nhigh\u201d (Luke 24:47-49).\nLuke\u2019s gospel discloses some of the content of the church\u2019s preaching:\n\u201crepentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name\u201d (v. 47).\nThis content can be summarized as follows: (1) unbelievers are called upon\nto repent of sins, (2) the offer of the gospel is forgiveness of sins, and (3) the\nchurch\u2019s preaching is in the name of Jesus because salvation from sin is by\nvirtue of the redeeming work of Jesus. Luke records, both in his gospel and\n\nin Acts, the Lord\u2019s charge regarding the necessary preparation for preaching:\n\u201cBut you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and\nyou shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and\nto the end of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:8, see also Luke 24:49). This Holy Spirit\nempowerment for preaching is also referenced in John 20:21-23.\nAccording to both Luke and Acts, Jesus commissioned the church\u2019s\npreachers to be His witnesses; they were not to preach the gospel as hearsay\nbut to herald what they first experienced. This is confirmed by the writings of\nJohn as well: \u201c\u2026that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that\nyou also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the\nFather and with His Son Jesus Christ\u201d (1 John 1:3; see also Luke 24:48; Acts\n1:8; 10:40-43; 1 Cor. 1:17-24; 9:16).\nMatthew\u2019s account of the Great Commission emphasizes the teaching\nmission of the church:\nAnd Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, \u201cAll authority\nhas been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go there-\nfore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them\nin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy\nSpirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have com-\nmanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end\nof the age\u201d Amen (Matt. 28:18-20).\nThe church\u2019s dual ministry, preaching and teaching, is evident through-\nout the book of Acts:\nAnd daily in the temple, and in every house, they did\nnot cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ\n(Acts 5:42).\nThey were continually devoting themselves to the apostles\u2019\nteaching\u2026(Acts 2:42, NASB).\n\nAnd when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.\nSo it was that for a whole year they assembled with the\nchurch and taught a great many people. And the disciples\nwere first called Christians in Antioch (Acts 11:26; see also\nActs 15:35; 18:11; 20:20; 28:31).\nPreaching is the recruiting and motivating ministry of the church; teach-\ning is the maturing ministry. Through preaching, new babes are born into\nGod\u2019s family; through teaching, the babes are matured from milk to strong\nmeat. It could be said that the church\u2019s work is twofold: winning and weaning\n(see 1 Cor. 3:1-2; Heb. 5:12-14).\nB. Discipling\nThe Great Commission in Matthew\u2019s gospel charged the church to go\nand teach all nations (28:19). The Greek word translated \u201cteach\u201d is matheteuo,\nfrom mathetes meaning \u201cdisciple.\u201d A central mission of the church is that of\ndiscipling all nations. Discipling is more than just teaching. Discipling occurs\nwhen truth is not only taught but lived out. It is possible to tell others how to\nbe victorious, but the one who disciples shows others how to live a victorious\nlife by example. Those who merely teach just have pupils, but those who dis-\nciple make followers. Jesus demonstrated this truth as did His disciples. Paul\nwrote about this kind of discipling in his letter to the Thessalonians:\nFor our gospel did not come to you in word only, but\nalso in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assur-\nance, as you know what kind of men we were among you\nfor your sake. And you became followers of us and of the\nLord, having received the word in much affliction, with\njoy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became examples to all\nin Macedonia and Achaia who believe (1 Thess. 1:5-7).\nThe great strength of the local church is its Christian community life. All\nlearn from one another, draw strength from one another and grow together\nin Spirit-filled, discipling Christian communities.\n\nC. Fellowship\nA mission of the church is to sustain the fellowship of believers. The early\nchurch was rich in fellowship: \u201cThey were continually devoting themselves\nto the apostles\u2019 teaching and to fellowship\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:42). The Greek word\nfor fellowship is koinonia, which means \u201ccommunion or that which is had in\ncommon or shared.\u201d The passage in Acts goes on to define fellowship: \u201cNow\nall who believed were together, and had all things in common\u2026\u201d (Acts 2:44).\nAlthough today the word fellowship is often used to describe church events\nthat include games, dining and social interactions, the word has a much\ndeeper meaning. The following are scriptural uses of koinonia:\n\u2022 Koinonia expressed as generosity and charity: \u201c\u2026imploring us with\nmuch urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of\nthe ministering to the saints. And not only as we had hoped, but\nthey first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of\nGod\u201d (2 Cor. 8:4-5).\n\u2022 Koinonia expressed as acceptance into the body of Christ: \u201c\u2026and\nwhen James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived\nthe grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the\nright hand of fellowship\u2026\u201d (Gal. 2:9).\n\u2022 Koinonia expressed as participation in the body of Christ: \u201c\u2026that\nI should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of\nChrist, and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 3:8-9).\n\u2022 Koinonia expressed as participation in salvation: \u201cI thank my\nGod\u2026for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until\nnow\u2026\u201d (Phil. 1:3-5).\n\u2022 Koinonia expressed through the Holy Spirit: \u201cTherefore if there is\nany\u2026fellowship of the Spirit\u2026\u201d (Phil. 2:1).\n\nT \u2022h e Doctrine of the Church \u2022 Chapter Eight 431\nPerhaps the apostle John summarized the clearest applications of bibli-\ncal fellowship:\n\u2026that which we have seen and heard we declare to you,\nthat you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our\nfellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus\nChrist\u2026If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and\nwalk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But\nif we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellow-\nship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His\nSon cleanses us from all sin (1 John 1:3, 6-7).\nFellowship is having a common relationship to the Father and the Son in\nthe body of Christ, where we are united by the Spirit in bonds of love, unity\nand singleness of purpose. This fellowship of believers extends to all mutual\nactivities that are God-honoring.\nD. Worship\nJesus said that the Father seeks the worship of those who will worship\nHim in spirit and in truth (John 4:23). An important mission of the church\nis to promote and sustain an atmosphere conducive to worship, prayer and\npraise: \u201cBut you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,\nHis own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called\nyou out of darkness into His marvelous light\u2026\u201d (1 Peter 2:9).\nIn the Old Testament, the worship of God was usually accompanied by\nthe offering of animal sacrifices. The New Testament church offers God the\nsacrifice of praise: \u201cTherefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of\npraise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name\u201d (Heb.\n13:15). Paul wrote that our lives are to be a continual expression of wor-\nship: \u201cTherefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your\nbodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual\nservice of worship\u201d (Rom. 12:1, NASB).\n\nIt is one of the works of the Holy Spirit to assist the believer in prayer,\nintercession, worship and praise: \u201cLikewise the Spirit also helps in our weak-\nnesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the\nSpirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be\nuttered\u201d (Rom. 8:26). An important aid in worship for Spirit-filled believers\nis their prayer language, by which they are able to worship God more deeply,\nfully and completely than they can by the sole means of the human intellect:\n\u201cFor he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God\u2026how-\never, in the spirit he speaks mysteries\u2026He who speaks in a tongue edifies\nhimself\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 14:2-4a). A spirit of worship, prayer and praise, almost\nwithout exception, has brought revival, renewal and growth to the church.\nE. Missions and evangelism\nThe Great Commission implies world evangelization. Jesus intended\nthat the gospel should be carried beyond Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria.\nThe gospel is good news for all nations, even \u201cto the end of the earth\u201d (Acts\n1:8). However, it took a devastating persecution to scatter the gospel and the\nevangelists as far as Antioch (Acts 8:1; 11:19-20). The church has frequently\nneeded special urging to get on with her assigned task. William Carey, one\nof the early fathers of modern missions, had to overcome strong resistance\nbefore he was freed to take the gospel to India. The fact cannot be urged\nupon the church too strongly that all nations have not yet been discipled and\nthe \u201cend of the earth\u201d has not been reached. Paul, the great missionary, chal-\nlenged the church with his testimony:\n\u2026in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the\nSpirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about\nto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.\nAnd so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not\nwhere Christ was named, lest I should build on another\nman\u2019s foundation, but as it is written: \u201cTo whom He was\nnot announced, they shall see; And those who have not\nheard shall understand\u201d (Rom. 15:19-21; see also 1 Cor.\n10: 14-16; Isa. 52:10).\n\nT \u2022h e Doctrine of the Church \u2022 Chapter Eight 433\nF. Maturity of the believer\nThe church has not completed her mission with making converts. A\ngreat part of the New Testament pertains to teaching, edifying and matur-\ning the believer. Paul explained very clearly the Lord\u2019s purpose for His body,\nthe church:\nAnd He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and\nsome as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for\nthe equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the\nbuilding up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to\nthe unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of\nGod, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which\nbelongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no\nlonger to be children, tossed here and there by waves and\ncarried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of\nmen, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the\ntruth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him\nwho is the head, even Christ\u2026(Eph. 4:11-15, NASB).\nThe Bible speaks of developing growth and maturity through the follow-\ning means: (1) prayer, Col. 4:12; (2) the Word of God, 1 Peter 2:2; Col. 1:28;\n(3) the exercise of faith, 1 Thess. 3:10; (4) patience in testing, James 1:2-4; 1\nPeter 1:7; (5) love, 1 Thess. 1:3; Col. 3:14; 1 John 2:5; 4:12; (6) grace,\n2 Peter 3:18; (7) Christian works, Heb. 13:21; and (8) spiritual gifts, Rom.\n1:11 (see also Heb. 6:1; 1 Cor. 3:1-2; 2 Tim. 2:15).\nG. Ministry in the home and family\nThe mission of the church extends into the home and concerns the life of\nthe family. This truth is demonstrated in the following scriptures:\n\u2022 Jesus had great concern and love for children (Mark 10:13-16).\n\u2022 Paul gave special instructions for all members of the Christian\nfamily (Eph. 5:33-6:4; Col. 3:18-21).\n\n\u2022 The promise of the Holy Spirit was to believers and their children\n(Acts 2:39).\n\u2022 When Paul made converts, he followed by witnessing to and\nbaptizing their whole family (Acts 16:15, 34; 18:8).\n\u2022 Church elders and deacons were required to have well-managed\nfamilies (1 Tim. 3:4-5, 12; Titus 1:6).\n\u2022 Many of the early churches were home churches where the gospel\ninfluenced the whole family life (Col. 4:15; Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor.\n16:19; Acts 21:4-5, 8-9).\nH. Ministry to material needs\nThe early church had a sincere concern for the material needs of people,\nespecially those of the Christian family. This social concern arose, no doubt,\nfrom the teaching of Jesus (see Matt. 25:34-46; Luke 10:25-37). The church\nis not charged to preach a \u201csocial gospel,\u201d but there are social implications\nto a biblical gospel. For example, The Foursquare Church, inspired by the\nworks of its founder, has from its beginning maintained a ministry called the\n\u201ccommissary,\u201d which ministered to the material, physical and spiritual needs\nof millions. That such ministry follows a scriptural precedent is seen in the\nfollowing passages:\n\u2022 The church in Jerusalem maintained a food service for widows and\nin a time of crisis chose special leadership from among the most\nspiritual men to solve problems (Acts 6:1-7).\n\u2022 Dorcas was well known in Joppa for her works of charity sewing\ngarments for the poor and widowed (Acts 9:36-42).\n\u2022 Each disciple in Antioch gave according to their ability to provide\nrelief with a famine in Judea (Acts 11:27-30).\n\n\u2022 Paul and his fellow workers took collections in all the Gentile\nchurches for the poor saints in Jerusalem. Much of the book of\n2 Corinthians relates to these collections. The passage \u201c\u2026for God\nloves a cheerful giver\u201d (2 Cor. 9:7b) refers to giving for material\nneeds (see also 2 Cor. 8-9).\n\u2022 Paul gave special instructions for the care of widows in his letter to\nTimothy (1 Tim. 5:3-10).\n\u2022 Christ\u2019s work of redemption is for the whole person: spirit, soul and\nbody.\nThe church is the Lord\u2019s instrument for implementing His provided\nblessing. The church, as well as individual believers, must reflect the compas-\nsion of Jesus, a compassion that is often best expressed in sharing with the less\nfortunate. James wrote:\nIf a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,\nand one of you says to them, \u201cDepart in peace, be warmed\nand filled,\u201d but you do not give them the things which are\nneeded for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by\nitself, if it does not have works, is dead (James 2:15-17).\nVI. The Ordinances of the Church\nThe ordinances of the local church are outward rites or symbolic obser-\nvances commanded by Jesus, which set forth essential Christian truths. The\nterm ordinance comes from the Latin word ordo, meaning \u201crow or order,\u201d and\nby extension, \u201csomething commanded and enforced by the proper authority.\u201d\nThe ordinances can be defined as \u201cthe outward sign of an inward work,\u201d\nor \u201cthe visible sign of an invisible work of grace.\u201d Although the Roman\nCatholic Church observes seven \u201csacraments,\u201d Jesus commanded the church\nto observe only the two ordinances of water baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper\n\n(Holy Communion). Almost all Protestant churches observe water baptism\nand the Lord\u2019s Supper as the two ordinances of the church.\nA. Water baptism\nJesus established water baptism as an ordinance in the Great Commission:\n\u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Matt. 28:19;\nsee also Mark 16:16). Jesus Himself set an example of the importance of\nbaptism through submitting to baptism by John the Baptist (Matt. 3:13-17).\nPeter reconfirmed the command to be baptized in his sermon on the day of\nPentecost (Acts 2:38-41). Throughout the book of Acts, the apostles observed\nthe ordinance of baptism, baptizing new converts (Acts 8:12, 36-38; 9:18;\n10:47-48; 16:15, 33; 18:8; 19:5-6; 22:16). The spiritual significance of water\nbaptism is also taught in the epistles (Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 10:2; Gal. 3:27).\n1. The manner of water baptism\na) Water baptism is by immersion: The Greek word baptizo means \u201cto\nimmerse or submerge.\u201d This also aligns with the manner of Jesus\u2019 baptism in\nthe Jordan River.\nb) Water baptism is Trinitarian: The formula for water baptism is clearly\nstated in the Great Commission as \u201cin the name of the Father and of the\nSon and of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matt. 28:19). When Peter told converts to \u201cbe\nbaptized in the name of Jesus Christ\u201d and omitted the longer formula, he\nwas most likely emphasizing that Christian baptism was distinct from John\u2019s\nbaptism (Acts 2:38).\n2. The significance of water baptism\nThe following statement from the Foursquare Declaration of Faith affirms\nthe doctrine of water baptism and explains the significance of the ordinance:\n\nWe believe that water baptism in the name of the Father\nand of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, according to the\ncommand of our Lord, is a blessed outward sign of an\ninward work, a beautiful and solemn emblem reminding\nus that even as our Lord died upon the cross of Calvary so\nwe reckon ourselves now dead indeed unto sin, and the old\nnature nailed to the tree with Him; and that even as He\nwas taken down from the tree and buried, so we are buried\nwith Him by baptism into His death; that like as Christ\nwas raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,\neven so we should walk in newness of life.5\nB. The Lord\u2019s Supper (Holy Communion)\nJesus, at His last Passover, instituted the ordinance of the taking of bread\nand the fruit of the vine as a memorial of His atoning death: \u201cAnd He took\nbread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u2018This is My\nbody which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me\u2019\u201d (Luke 22:19).\nIn the book of Acts, the observance of the Lord\u2019s Supper is referred to as \u201cthe\nbreaking of bread.\u201d While the disciples frequently broke bread as a love feast\nof fellowship, the feast was concluded with the Lord\u2019s Supper (Acts 2:42, 46;\n20:7, 11; 27:35). The clearest evidence that the church observed the Lord\u2019s\nSupper as an ordinance is found in the teaching of the apostle Paul:\nFor I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to\nyou: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He\nwas betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks,\nHe broke it and said, \u201cTake, eat; this is My body which\nis broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\u201d In the\nsame manner He also took the cup after supper, saying,\n\u201cThis cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as\noften as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\u201d For as often\nas you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim\nthe Lord\u2019s death till He comes (1 Cor. 11:23-26; see also\n10:16-21; 11:20-22, 27-34).\n5 McPherson, 15.\n\n1. The nature of the Lord\u2019s Supper\na) The Lord\u2019s Supper is an act of obedience to the Lord\u2019s command.\nRegardless of the blessings believers derive from observing the ordinance, it\nis to be kept out of obedience to Christ, the head of the church (1 Cor.\n11:23-24).\nb) The Lord\u2019s Supper is a memorial to the atoning death and shed blood\nof Jesus (1 Cor. 11:24; Luke 22:19).\nc) The Lord\u2019s Supper is a proclamation, an act of confession by the church\nof faith in the efficacy of Christ\u2019s atoning work. In the Lord\u2019s Supper believers\n\u201cproclaim the Lord\u2019s death\u201d (1 Cor. 11:26).\nd) The Lord\u2019s Supper is a statement of anticipation of the return of Christ\nto finalize His redeeming work. When believers partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper,\nthey \u201cproclaim the Lord\u2019s death till He comes\u201d (1 Cor. 11:26).\ne) The Lord\u2019s Supper is an experience of communion with the Lord in\nwhich participants receive by faith the strength and blessing of fellowship\nwith the Savior: \u201cThe bread which we break, is it not the communion [koino-\nnia] of the body of Christ?\u201d (1 Cor. 10:16).\nf) The Lord\u2019s Supper is a communion (koinonia) of believers at the Lord\u2019s\ntable and a statement of the oneness of the body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17).\n2. Four views of the nature of the elements of the Lord\u2019s Supper\na) Holy Communion: This view holds that the elements, when received\nby faith, mediate to the believer the spiritual benefits of Christ\u2019s death. The\nelements in themselves are only tokens, but when believers receive the Lord\u2019s\nSupper by faith, they experience real communion with the Lord and the ben-\nefits of that communion. Calvin and the majority of the reformers held this\nperspective of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Scripture also supports this understanding\nof Holy Communion (see 1 Cor. 10:16; 11:27-29).\n\nb) Remembrance or memorial: This view describes the Lord\u2019s Supper as\npurely a memorial or symbolic act of remembrance. In this view, communion\nis beneficial because it reminds believers of what Christ has done through His\ndeath on the cross.\nc) Transubstantiation: According to this view, the elements, when blessed\nby a priest, are changed into the actual physical body and blood of Jesus.\nTransubstantiation is taught by the Roman Catholic Church. This view is\ncontradicted by experience, for testing does not show that the elements phys-\nically change when blessed by a priest. Also, logic contradicts the conclusion\nthat the bread and wine actually become Christ\u2019s body and blood, for Jesus\nwas still in His physical body when He instituted the ordinance and said of\nthe bread, \u201cthis is My body.\u201d\nd) Consubstantiation: According to this view, the elements are unchanged,\nbut the actual body and blood of Jesus are \u201cpresent with\u201d the elements. Martin\nLuther believed in the idea of consubstantiation. However, the concept that\nthe body and blood of Jesus are present with the elements is not taught any-\nwhere in Scripture. This understanding of the elements overemphasizes the\nphysical over the spiritual blessings of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n3. Partaking in a worthy manner\nWhen providing instructions about the Lord\u2019s Supper, Paul gave the fol-\nlowing warning: \u201cTherefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the\nLord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the\nLord\u201d (1 Cor. 11:27-29). Some believers have misunderstood this warning\nand abstained from the Lord\u2019s Supper unnecessarily. \u201cUnworthy\u201d is an adverb\nin this verse modifying the verbs \u201ceats\u201d and \u201cdrinks.\u201d Unworthy describes\nthe manner of partaking, not the unworthiness of the persons. Paul\u2019s warn-\ning was referring to the greedy and intemperate manner of the Corinthians\ndescribed in 1 Corinthians 11:20-22. Individuals are not worthy in and of\nthemselves to have communion with Jesus, but we are given the privilege to\npartake of the Lord\u2019s Supper by virtue of the atoning work of Christ, which\nthe elements represent. However, participants need to examine themselves in\nrelation to their manner of partaking the Lord\u2019s Supper and in their attitude\n\ntowards other believers. Participants, furthermore, should be certain to dis-\ncern the Lord\u2019s body and not partake in an irreverent or frivolous manner.\nWhen believers partake in faith, the Lord\u2019s Supper brings great blessings, even\nspiritual and physical healing (1 Cor. 11:29-30).\nThe Foursquare Declaration of Faith states the following regarding the\nLord\u2019s Supper:\nWe believe in the commemoration and observing of the\nLord\u2019s supper by the sacred use of the broken bread, a pre-\ncious type of the Bread of Life even Jesus Christ, whose\nbody was broken for us; and by the juice of the vine, a\nblessed type which should ever remind the participant\nof the shed blood of the Savior who is the True Vine of\nwhich His children are the branches; that this ordinance is\na glorious rainbow that spans the gulf of the years between\nCalvary and the coming of the Lord\u20266\nVII. The Church as the Body of Christ\nAlthough Spirit-directed organization helps the church carry out her\nmission, the church is not by nature an organization but an organism. The\nchurch is a living being whose divine life is provided by the indwelling Spirit\nof Christ (Rom. 8:9).\nA. The church\u2019s vital relationship to the head\nThe Lord Jesus, after His earthly mission, ascended to the right hand\nof the Father. However, Christ is still in the world manifesting Himself\nthrough His body, the church. Paul expressed this reality in the following\nway: \u201cAnd He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over\nall things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all\nin all\u201d (Eph. 1:22-23).\n6 McPherson, 15-16.\n\nThe church is Christ\u2019s body by which He fulfills His earthly mission\n(Christ\u2019s fullness). The last two verses of Mark\u2019s gospel express dramatically\nthe relationship of Christ to the church: \u201cThe Lord Jesus therefore, on the\none hand, after talking with them was taken up into heaven, and sat down\non the right hand of God; they on the other hand, going forth, proclaimed\non every side, the Lord coworking, and confirming the Word through closely\nfollowing signs\u201d (Mark 16:19-20, Rotherham).\nJesus returned to the Father, but just before He left, He promised,\n\u201c\u2026lo, I am with you always\u2026\u201d (Matt. 28:20). He is with us as a head is with\na body. Christ is still working on earth, performing even \u201cgreater works\u201d than\nbefore (John 14:12); the members of His church are His arms and legs and\nmouth (see 1 Cor. 12:12-31; Rom. 12:4-5). The church is the extension of\nthe Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus expressed this relationship through the metaphor\nof a vine and branches: \u201cI am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides\nin Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing\u201d\n(John 15:5). The branches relate to the vine in the same way the body relates\nto the head. The branches are the body of the vine. Just as the vine bears fruit\nthrough the branches, so the work of Christ is done through the church, His\nbody. Just as the branches can do nothing severed from the vine, so the body\n(the church) can accomplish nothing without the life and direction of the\nhead (Jesus).\nB. The unity of the body\nThe body metaphor of Scripture emphasizes strongly the unity of the\nmany members of the church. The church (body) of Christ is not merely a\ncollection of individuals who subscribe to a shared theology or philosophy.\nInstead, the church is an organism of which the members are interrelated\nparts. Paul described the unity of the church in the following manner:\nBut now God has set the members, each one of them, in\nthe body just as He pleased\u2026But now indeed there are\nmany members, yet one body. And the eye cannot say to\nthe hand, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d; nor again the head to\nthe feet, \u201cI have no need of you\u201d\u2026And if one member\n\nsuffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member\nis honored, all the members rejoice with it (1 Cor. 12:18,\n20-21, 26).\nThere are many ministries in the church, but they are all coordinated by\nthe Spirit to achieve one purpose: \u201c\u2026the equipping of the saints for the work\nof ministry\u2026\u201d (Eph. 4:12). There are many gifts of the Spirit, but they are all\nexercised in harmony to accomplish one end: \u201c\u2026the edifying of the body of\nChrist\u2026\u201d (Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 12:4-7; 14:5, 12, 26). There are many method-\nologies employed by the church, but they have one goal: \u201c\u2026this gospel of the\nkingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations\u2026\u201d\n(Matt. 24:14; 28:19-20; Mark 16:15).\nC. The importance of each member in the body\nEvery member of the body of Christ is important and necessary: \u201cAnd\nthe eye cannot say to the hand, \u2018I have no need of you\u2019; nor again the head\nto the feet, \u2018I have no need of you.\u2019 No, much rather, those members of the\nbody which seem to be weaker are necessary\u2026that there should be no schism\nin the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another\u201d\n(1 Cor. 12:21-22, 25). Dr. F.F. Bruce, commenting on 1 Corinthians 12,\nremarked: \u201cNo member is less a part of the body than any other member:\nall are necessary. Variety of organs, limbs and functions is of the essence of\nbodily life. No organ could establish a monopoly in the body by taking over\nthe functions of the others. A body consisting of a single organ would be a\nmonstrosity.\u201d7\nD. Submission in the body\nThere are many members of the body of Christ, but there is but one\nhead, the Lord Jesus Christ. The members cannot function properly without\nfull submission to the head who provides direction to the whole body (1 Cor.\n12:4-7): \u201cAnd He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head\n7 Frederick Fyvie Bruce, The New Century Bible Commentary: 1 and 2 Corinthians (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.\nEerdmans Publishing Company, 1978).\n\nover all things to the church\u2026\u201d (Eph. 1:22). There are four ways in which\nChristian believers practice submission:\n1. Submission to God and to His Son Jesus (Eph. 5:24; Heb. 2:8; 12:9;\nJames 4:7)\n2. Submission to the God-appointed leaders of the church (Heb. 13:17;\n1 Cor. 16:16; Phil. 2:12; 1 Thess. 5:12-13)\n3. Submission one to another in Christ (Eph. 5:21-6:9; 1 Peter 5:5)\n4. Submission to rulers and governing authorities when submission does\nnot disobey the teachings of Scripture (Acts 4:19-20; 5:29; Rom. 13:1-7;\n1 Peter 2:13-17)\nE. The body of Christ and the local church\nThe universal body of Christ consists of the total number of Christian\nbelievers of all ages in heaven and on earth. The New Testament scrip-\ntures address all earthly believers as functioning members of a local church.\nUnfortunately, there are many professing Christians who believe a local\nchurch relationship is optional or unnecessary. The following arguments\ndemonstrate why a local church relationship is important for every believer:\n1. Jesus assumed that His people would be related to a local church.\nBecause the New Testament church\u2019s founding was established after His ascen-\nsion, Jesus refers to the church by name only twice. The second reference per-\ntained to cases of disagreements between brethren in which Jesus instructed:\n\u201cAnd if he refuses to hear them [witnesses], tell it to the church. But if he\nrefuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax\ncollector\u201d (Matt. 18:17). It is evident Jesus believed the local church was cen-\ntral to Christian life as it had the power to arbitrate disputes among believers.\n2. All the epistles of the New Testament are addressed to local churches\nor to leaders of local churches.\n\n3. All ministries, which are God\u2019s gifts, are given to local church commu-\nnities to equip saints for ministry to one another. Apostles, prophets, evan-\ngelists, pastors and teachers minister with other believers as they assemble\ntogether in fellowship (Eph. 4:11-16).\n4. Believers are commanded by Jesus to partake of Holy Communion\ntogether until He returns (1 Cor. 11:23-26).\n5. The Scripture describes the operation of the gifts of the Spirit as func-\ntioning in a local body. Paul wrote that when believers exercise the gifts of the\nSpirit, they should \u201c\u2026let it be for the edification of the church that you seek\nto excel\u201d (1 Cor. 14:12).\n6. As members of the body of Christ, believers are related not only to\nChrist, the head, but they are also related one to another: \u201c\u2026so we, being\nmany, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another\u201d\n(Rom. 12:5). Any member of the human body cannot exist only connected\nto the head, in isolation. Each member of the body of Christ needs both a\nconnection with the head and with the rest of the body to properly function\n(1 Cor. 12:14-20).\n7. Scripture states that God places members in the body as it pleases Him\n(1 Cor. 12:18).\n8. For Christians to carry out the commission of Christ, there must be\ngrowing fellowship, evangelism and worldwide missions through an active,\naccountable and visible church (Acts 2:41-47; 11:26-30; 13:1-3).\nF. Body ministry\nThe concept of the church as the body of Christ has led to important\ninsights for worship and ministry. Too often people have viewed ministry as\ncoming exclusively from the pulpit or designated clergy. When ministry is\nperceived as the act of professionals, the members of congregations become\nmerely spectators. The Bible does not support such a limited view of ministry.\n\nGod has placed spiritual leadership in the church to preach and teach, but\nthe object of this preaching, teaching and pastoral care is that of equipping\nbelievers to minister one to another and to the world:\nAnd He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets,\nsome evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the\nequipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edi-\nfying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity\nof the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a\nperfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to\nand fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by\nthe trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful\nplotting, but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all\nthings into Him who is the head\u2014Christ\u2026(Eph. 4:11-15).\nPaul\u2019s teaching concerning body ministry reveals the following truths:\n1. The Lord intends that every member of the body of Christ should have\na ministry. Every member of the human body contributes to the preservation,\ngrowth, health and activity of the body. If a specific member or part of the\nhuman body does not function properly, the body will not work properly.\nMany problems in the church are the result of non-functioning members. To\nfacilitate participation in the ministry of the church, God has provided spiri-\ntual leadership to equip and mature believers. God has also given believers the\ngifts of the Spirit to give them direction and to empower their functioning\nin the body.\n2. Body ministry should equip and edify the whole church (Eph. 4:12).\nBelievers demonstrate the value and validity of their body ministry through\nthe way their spiritual activity edifies and equips the body of Christ. Peter\nwrote: \u201cAs each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God\u201d (1 Pet. 4:10). Believers are called to\nsteward the ministry and gifts God has provided. God gives gifts to believers,\nnot just for their own edification but for the edification of the church family.\n\n3. When the whole body ministers in unity and love, the result is spiritual\nand numeric growth. Paul referenced this growth when he wrote about Christ\nand the church: \u201c...from whom the whole body, joined and knit together\nby what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which\nevery part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself\nin love\u201d (Eph. 4:16). Church leaders, pastors, evangelists and missionaries\ncannot accomplish optimum growth without the entire church ministering.\n4. When the church functions as the body of Christ, the adhesive force\nof love is present. Unless church participation is motivated by and carried out\nin a spirit of love, the growth accomplished will be transient and the ministry\nperformed will be less than edifying. \u201cSince you have purified your souls in\nobeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one\nanother fervently with a pure heart\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 1:22; see also 1 Cor. 13; Gal.\n5:13; Eph. 3:17-19; 4:2-3, 15-16; Phil. 2:1-5; Col. 3:12-15; 1 Thess. 5:12-13).\nVIII. The Church and the Kingdom of God\nThe phrases \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d and \u201ckingdom of God\u201d are found\nmore than eighty times in the New Testament. The kingdom of God is an\nimportant subject. Several questions arise in relation to the identity and man-\nifestation of the kingdom of God: What does the word kingdom mean? Is\nthe kingdom of God an inner spiritual reality or is it an outwardly visible\nrule? Who are the subjects of the kingdom? Are the kingdom of God and the\nkingdom of heaven identical? What relationship does the church have to the\nkingdom of God? Is the kingdom of God present or future? The following\nsection will address and answer these and other important questions concern-\ning the church and the kingdom of God.\nA. What does the word kingdom mean?\nThe Greek word basileia, from which the word kingdom is derived, has\ntwo principle meanings: (1) \u201ca king\u2019s rule, reign, dominion or authority,\u201d\nand (2) \u201cthe territory or people over whom a king reigns.\u201d W.E. Vine defined\n\nbasileia as follows: \u201cBasileia is primarily an abstract noun, denoting sover-\neignty, royal power, dominion, e.g., Rv. 17:18, translated \u2018which reigneth,\u2019\nlit. \u2018hath a kingdom\u2019\u2026then, by metonymy, a concrete noun, denoting the\nterritory or people over whom a king rules, e.g., Mt. 4:8; Mk. 3:24.\u201d8 In\nthe Greek Old Testament, basileia translates the Hebrew word malkut which\nlikewise has the two meanings: (1) \u201croyal reign\u201d (Dan. 1:1), and (2) \u201cking\u2019s\ndomain.\u201d The word kingdom is used most frequently in the New Testament\nwith the meaning of reign or royal power. Regarding the word kingdom,\nGeorge Eldon Ladd said: \u201cThe primary meaning of the New Testament word\nfor kingdom, basileia, is \u2018reign\u2019 rather than \u2018realm\u2019 or \u2018people.\u2019 A great deal of\nattention in recent years has been devoted by critical scholars to this subject,\nand there is practically unanimous agreement that \u2018regal power, authority\u2019 is\nmore basic to basileia than \u2018realm\u2019 or \u2018people.\u2019\u201d9\nB. Is the kingdom of God present or future?\nThe kingdom of God is both present and future. The kingdom of God is\nfuture in that the realm of God\u2019s people of all dispensations, over which Christ\nwill reign in righteousness, will begin in the future with the second coming of\nChrist (2 Tim. 4:1; Rev. 11:15). The kingdom of God as the \u201creign\u201d or \u201croyal\npower\u201d of God is present in the redeeming work of Jesus who came to destroy\nthe works of the devil. Dr. Ladd stated:\nThe kingdom has come in that the powers of the future\nkingdom have already come into history and into human\nexperience through the supernatural ministry of the\nMessiah which has effected the defeat of Satan. Men\nmay now experience the reality of the reign of God. In\nthe future eschatological kingdom Satan will be utterly\ndestroyed, cast into a lake of fire and brimstone (Rev.\n20:10) that men may be freed from every influence of evil.\nHowever, God\u2019s people need not wait for the coming of\n8 William Edwy Vine, Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words (Old Tappan, NJ: Fleming H. Revell\nPublishing Company, 1958) 294-296.\n9 George E. Ladd, Crucial Questions About the Kingdom of God (Grand Rapids, MI: Win. B. Eerdmans Publish-\ning Company, 1977) 78.\n\nthe future kingdom to know what it means to be delivered\nfrom Satanic power. The presence of Christ on earth had\nfor its purpose the defeat of Satan, his binding, so that\nGod\u2019s power may be a vital reality in the experience of\nthose who yield to God\u2019s reign by becoming the disciples\nof Jesus. In Christ, the kingdom, in the form of its power,\nhas come among men.10\nC. Is the kingdom of God an inner spiritual reality or an outwardly visible rule?\nThe future (eschatological) kingdom will be an outwardly manifested\nkingdom over which Christ will reign in power and glory. The future kingdom\nof God will prevail over the whole earth and will fulfill the Old Testament\nprophecies to the faithful remnant of Israel, concerning Messiah\u2019s reign upon\nthe throne of David (Isa. 9:6-7; 11:1-10; 24:23; 32:13; Dan. 2:44; 7:18-27;\nMic. 4:7). The New Testament saints will rule and reign with Christ as kings\nand priests (Matt. 25:21-23; 1 Tim. 6:14-15; Rev. 5:9-10; 19:14-16; 20:4-6).\nThe thousand-year reign of Christ over the earth is known as His millennial\nreign. Although the word millennium does not occur in the Bible, it is the\nLatin word for \u201cthousand years\u201d (Rev. 20:4-6).\nOn the other hand, the present kingdom of Christ is spiritual and invis-\nible, for it consists of the kingship, power and authority of Jesus as savior\nand destroyer of Satan. The spiritual nature of the kingdom of God is made\nclear by two statements of Jesus. In the first statement, when answering the\nPharisees\u2019 question concerning when the kingdom would come, Jesus said:\n\u201cThe kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say,\n\u2018See here!\u2019 or \u2018See there!\u2019 For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you\u201d\n(Luke 17:20b-21). In Jesus\u2019 second statement, when Pilate asked Him if He\nwere a king, \u201cJesus answered, \u2018My Kingdom is not of this world\u2026\u2019\u201d (John\n18:36). Jesus went on to say that He was born to be a king over the realm of\ndivine truth and that \u201cEveryone who is of the truth hears My voice\u201d (John\n18:37). Jesus said to Nicodemus, \u201c\u2026unless one is born again, he cannot see\nthe kingdom of God\u2026unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot\n10 Ladd, 91.\n\nenter the kingdom of God\u201d (John 3:3, 5). Those who are born again enter\ninto Jesus\u2019 kingdom: the divine saving truth of the gospel. Jesus\u2019 present king-\ndom on earth is a kingdom of the gospel and is why the gospel is called the\n\u201cgospel of the kingdom\u201d (Matt. 4:23-24; 9:15; 24:14; Mark 1:14; Luke 4:43;\nsee also Acts 1:3; 8:12; 19:8; 28:23, 31). Those who accept the gospel of Jesus\nalso accept Him as sovereign Lord and master, entering into His kingdom as\ncitizens of heaven (Phil. 3:20).\nThe gospel is the central message of Jesus\u2019 present kingdom or \u201cking-\nship.\u201d However, the gospel is not abstract or passive but dynamic, \u201cthe power\nof God unto salvation\u201d (Rom. 1:16). Writing to the Thessalonians about the\ngospel, Paul said: \u201cFor our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also\nin power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance\u2026\u201d (1 Thess. 1:5).\nThe result of Paul\u2019s preaching to the Thessalonians was they \u201c\u2026turned to\nGod from idols to serve the living and true God\u2026\u201d (1 Thess. 1:9). Scripture\nclearly declares that at conversion believers immediately enter the kingdom\nof God: \u201cHe has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us\ninto the kingdom of the Son of His love\u2026\u201d (Col. 1:13). Jesus brought the\nkingdom into this present age through exercising dominion over Satan and\nhis realm of darkness: \u201cBut if I cast out demons with the finger of God, surely\nthe kingdom of God has come upon you\u201d (Luke 11:20). The spiritual nature\nof the present \u201creign\u201d of God is affirmed by Paul in Romans: \u201c\u2026for the king-\ndom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy\nin the Holy Spirit\u201d (Rom. 14:17).\nD. Are the church and the kingdom of God identical?\nThe final and complete manifestation of the eschatological kingdom of\nGod is yet future. However, the power, authority and message of the king-\ndom were introduced into the present age and bestowed upon the church by\nJesus, who said to His apostles, \u201c\u2026on this rock I will build My church\u2026And\nI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\u2026\u201d (Matt. 16:18-19). The\nkingdom of God as the \u201cdomain\u201d of God is yet to come, but the kingdom\nas the \u201cdominion\u201d of God has already broken into the present age, and the\nchurch exercises the power of that kingdom. The church is not identical to\nthe kingdom of God, for the kingdom is larger than the church. However,\n\nthe church is the present instrument of the kingdom and will inherit the\nkingdom (James 2:5; 2 Pet. 1:11).\nThe ultimate kingdom of God will include not only the church but also\nthe Old Testament saints, the future regathered remnant of Israel and the righ-\nteous nations that will be part of the millennial reign of Jesus (Matt. 25:32-33;\nRev. 20:4; Isa. 66:18-23; Jer. 3:16-18; 23:3-6; 31:10-12; Zech. 14:8-9).\nE. Is the kingdom of heaven different from the kingdom of God?\nSome Bible scholars (including the Scofield Chain Reference Bible\neditors, see footnotes in Scofield on Matt. 3:2) teach that the phrase \u201cthe\nkingdom of heaven,\u201d found only in Matthew, usually refers to professing\nChristendom, while \u201cthe kingdom of God,\u201d used by Mark, Luke and John,\nrefers to God\u2019s sovereign reign. In His parables, Jesus sometimes extended the\n\u201ckingdom\u201d concept to include the sphere of outward profession, such as in\nthe example of the tares and wheat in Matthew 13:24-30. However, a close\ncomparison of the terms \u201ckingdom of God\u201d and \u201ckingdom of heaven,\u201d as they\nare used in all four Gospels, shows they have the same meaning. For instance,\nin the Beatitudes, Matthew\u2019s gospel says the poor will inherit the \u201ckingdom\nof heaven,\u201d while Luke\u2019s gospel says they will inherit the \u201ckingdom of God\u201d\n(Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20). In Matthew, the disciples are sent forth to preach that\nthe \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d is at hand; while in Luke, they announce that the\n\u201ckingdom of God\u201d is at hand (Matt. 10:6-7; Luke 9:2; see also Matt 4:17;\nMark 1:15). In the context where Jesus referred to the parables as teaching\nthe \u201cmysteries of the kingdom,\u201d Matthew\u2019s gospel refers to Jesus\u2019 teachings as\nmysteries of the \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d (13:11), while in Mark\u2019s gospel (4:11)\nthey are mysteries of the \u201ckingdom of God.\u201d In one Matthew passage, Jesus\nused both terms in the same figure of speech with exactly the same meaning\n(Matt. 19:23-24). In one sentence Jesus stated, \u201c\u2026it is hard for a rich man to\nenter the kingdom of heaven\u2026\u201d while in the next sentence He mentioned,\n\u201cAnd again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a nee-\ndle, than for the rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d These comparisons\nclearly demonstrate that the terms \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d and \u201ckingdom of\nGod\u201d were interchangeable in usage.\n\nIX. Other Metaphors for the Church\nUp to this point, we have given special consideration to metaphors for\nthe church such as the \u201cbody of Christ\u201d and the church as \u201ca holy nation.\u201d\nWe have examined the church as the body of Christ because of its scriptural\nprominence and contemporary application, and we have looked at the church\nas a holy nation or \u201ckingship\u201d to better understand the different interpreta-\ntions of the word \u201ckingdom.\u201d However, the metaphors applied to the church\nin Scripture are many because no metaphor can fully express the relationship\nof believers to Christ, to one another and to the world. The following are\ntwenty-four additional metaphors, each of which adds something to the total\nconcept of the church.\nA. The church as the Lord\u2019s family\nJesus introduced us to the family relationship, teaching us to pray \u201c\u2026Our\nFather in heaven\u2026\u201d (Matt. 6:9; Luke 11:2). God, the Father of our Lord\nJesus Christ, is also our Father. Jesus prayed using the Aramaic word Abba.\nAccording to Romans 8:15, the believer in the spirit of adoption cries \u201cAbba,\nFather.\u201d If we, together with our Lord Jesus, call God \u201cFather,\u201d then Jesus is\nalso our elder brother in the family of God (Heb. 2:10-11). The author of\nHebrews declared that believers are members of God\u2019s family: \u201cBut Christ\nwas faithful as a loyal son in the household of the founder, his own Father.\nAnd we are members of this household if we maintain our trust and joyful\nhope steadfast to the end\u201d (Heb. 3:6 Phillips). As families are often proud of\nthe family name, so the church family exults in the Father\u2019s name (Eph. 3:14-\n15). As families receive inheritances from their fathers, so the church awaits\nthe heavenly Father\u2019s promised inheritance (Rom. 8:17). As good families\nobserve a certain pattern of conduct, so there is a given standard of behavior\nfor God\u2019s household (1 Tim. 3:15). In the Old Testament, the father of each\nhousehold was, in effect, the priest over his household (Num. 7:2). Jesus\nhas become the High Priest over God\u2019s family, the church (Heb. 10:21-23;\n2:17-18).\nThe idea of the church as God\u2019s family and household is derived from the\nOld Testament where God\u2019s people are the house (family) of Israel, a nation\n\ngrown from the family of Jacob, nurtured through family culture. That the\nchurch is called God\u2019s family and household testifies to the basic importance\nof the family as a societal institution. In the New Testament, especially in\nActs, much is made of the effect of the gospel upon entire families: Acts 2:46;\n5:42; 12:12; 16:15, 33-34; 21:8-9; 1 Cor. 1:16; 16:15; 2 Tim. 4:19.\nThe Old Testament speaks primarily of God as the Father of the whole\nhouse of Israel (Isa. 5:7; Ps. 98:3), while the New Testament teaches follow-\ners that calling God \u201cFather\u201d is the privilege of every believer in Jesus Christ\nthe Son.\nB. The church as a fellowship of believers\nThe Greek word for \u201cfellowship\u201d is koinonia, which means \u201cthose having\nsomething in common.\u201d Koinonia came to be applied to \u201cthose belonging\nto a society.\u201d Koinonia was used in the church for those having a common\nsalvation through a common faith in God and in His Son Christ Jesus: \u201c\u2026that\nwhich we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have\nfellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His\nSon Jesus Christ\u201d (1 John 1:3; see also 1 Cor. 1:9). As soon as the church\ncame into being, a strong fellowship of faith, worship and service was estab-\nlished: \u201cAnd they continued steadfastly in the apostles\u2019 doctrine and fellow-\nship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers\u201d (Acts 2:42). The metaphor of\nthe \u201cfamily\u201d stresses the idea of a common \u201cFather,\u201d while the metaphor of\nthe \u201cfellowship of believers\u201d stresses the idea of common mission, purpose,\nworship and action.\nOnly a strong sense of unity makes a great society. The church is God\u2019s\nnew society held together by the unity of the Spirit. Luke says about the\napostolic church: \u201cNow all who believed were together, and had all things in\ncommon [koinos]\u201d (Acts 2:44). The doctrine of the church is most fully devel-\noped in the New Testament epistle of Ephesians. Ephesians does not use the\nword koinonia, but it is the only New Testament book to use the term \u201cunity\u201d\n(Eph. 4:3-6, 13). The church as God\u2019s koinonia stresses the idea of a society\nwhose primary characteristics are unity and love. One practical expression of\nthe church\u2019s love was that of sharing with the needy. Koinonia is sometimes\n\ntranslated \u201ccommunicate,\u201d with the meaning of extending material help\nto the poor and to those overtaken by misfortune (see Phil. 4:14; 1 Tim.\n6:18; Heb. 13:16; Acts 2:45; 2 Cor. 8:4; 9:13; Gal. 2:10; Rom. 12:13). The\nchurch\u2019s koinonia (also translated \u201ccommunion\u201d) is celebrated at the Lord\u2019s\nSupper, which symbolizes our common redemption by Christ\u2019s atoning death\non the cross (1 Cor. 10:16-17; 11:23-34). John R.W. Stott, in a commentary\non Ephesians, wrote the following:\nThe letter focuses on what God did through the historical\nwork of Jesus Christ and does through His Spirit today, in\norder to build His new society in the midst of the old. We\nhave been raised from spiritual death, exalted to heaven\nand seated with Him there. We have also been reconciled\nto God and to each other. As a result, through Christ, and\nin Christ, we are nothing less than God\u2019s society, the single\nnew humanity which He is creating and which includes\nJews and Gentiles on equal terms. We are the family of\nGod the Father, the body of Jesus Christ His Son, and the\ntemple and dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Therefore\nwe are to demonstrate plainly and visibly by our new life\nthe reality of this new thing which God has done: first by\nthe unity... of our common life, secondly by the purity and\nlove of our everyday behaviour.1\nC. The church as a team of athletes\nAthletic events were as common in the Greek and Roman world as they\nare today. Paul, who was a keen observer, frequently used the \u201cathletic\u201d met-\naphor (see 1 Cor. 9:24-26; Gal. 2:2; 5:7; Phil. 2:16; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 2:5;\n4:7; Heb. 12:1). The passage with this type of metaphor that best applies to\nthe church is \u201c\u2026that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving\ntogether for the faith of the gospel\u2026\u201d (Phil. 1:27). The Greek word translated\n\u201cstriving together\u201d is sunathleo, from athleo (the base word for \u201cathletics\u201d)\n1 John R.W. Stott, God\u2019s New Society, The Message of Ephesians (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1980)\n24-25.\n\nmeaning to \u201ccompete as an athlete,\u201d and sun meaning \u201cwith\u201d or \u201ctogether.\u201d\nPaul wanted to hear from the Philippians that they were in unity, \u201cplaying as a\nteam.\u201d The church\u2019s greatest advancement and growth has not been the result\nof individual efforts but the result of the mutual effort and teamwork of the\nwhole family of God. When Christian believers behave like a team of well-\ntrained athletes, they display such characteristics as dedication, teamwork,\ncooperation, self-denial, self-control and unity.\nD. The church as the Lord\u2019s army\nThe idea of viewing the church as an army is probably not pleasant for\nsome people. However, the Bible often refers to the church being engaged\nin a battle against the powers of darkness. Some of our aversion to the mil-\nitary metaphor is removed when we remember that \u201c\u2026the weapons of our\nwarfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,\ncasting down arguments and\u2026bringing every thought into captivity to the\nobedience of Christ\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 10:4-5). The believer is further exhorted:\n\u201cPut on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the\nwiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against\nprincipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,\nagainst spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\u201d (Eph. 6:11-12).\nThe church is engaged in real warfare, but Christ is our captain, and we are\nassured of victory. Satan is already a defeated foe (see 1 Cor. 9:7; Eph. 6:10-\n17; 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 2:3-4; 1 Pet. 2:11; Rev. 19:11-21; 20:7). Although\nthe Bible uses militant terms to describe the church on earth, the church in\nheaven is triumphant.\nE. The church as the Lord\u2019s flock\nThe pastoral metaphor is a very familiar one. A spiritual leader of a local\nchurch is often called the pastor, and the congregation he or she serves is\nsometimes referred to as the \u201cflock.\u201d Jesus taught that He is the good shep-\nherd, and His followers are the sheep of His fold (John 10:1-18). Although\nthe New Testament uses the word pastor only once to designate a spiritual\nleader, both Paul and Peter give vivid examples of the pastoral metaphor.\nWhile ministering to the Ephesian elders, Paul exhorted \u201c\u2026take heed to\n\nyourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you\noverseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own\nblood\u201d (Acts 20:28). Peter urged the elders, \u201cShepherd the flock of God which\nis among you\u2026being examples to the flock; and when the Chief Shepherd\nappears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away\u201d (1 Pet.\n5:2-4). In this admonition, Peter likely remembered the words Jesus spoke\nand repeated to him three times after the resurrection: \u201cSimon\u2026do you love\nMe more than these?\u2026Feed My lambs\u2026Tend My sheep\u2026Feed My sheep\u201d\n(John 21:15-17; see also Ps. 23:1; 80:1; 100:3; 2 Sam. 7:7; Jer. 31:10; Mark\n6:34; Eph. 4:11; Heb. 13:20; Rev. 7:17).\nF. The church as the Lord\u2019s school\nMore than fifty times the Scripture refers to Jesus as \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201cteacher\u201d\n(both words are from the Greek word didaskalos and the verb didasko mean-\ning \u201cto teach\u201d) or \u201cRabbi.\u201d Jesus discipled His followers through teaching.\nThe Great Commission clearly implies that the local church is intended to\nbe a place for teaching: \u201cHaving gone, then, disciple all the nations, bap-\ntizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy\nSpirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you; and\nbehold, I am with you all the days until the completion of the age\u201d (Matt.\n28:19-20 IGEB; see also NKJV, NIV, NASB, RSV and JB translation). Jesus\nused two different words for \u201cteach\u201d in His commission: the first is matheteuo\n(v. 19), meaning \u201cto make disciples\u201d and the second didasko (v. 20), which is\nthe common word for \u201cto teach.\u201d The emphatic term in the commission is\n\u201cmake disciples.\u201d In the Greek \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cteaching\u201d are participles, and both\nare subordinate to the main verb \u201cmake disciples.\u201d Making disciples involves\nmore than just teaching and preaching but a life lived by example. Our teach-\ning and preaching will fall on deaf ears if the conduct of our lives contradicts\nthe message we proclaim. Anyone who makes disciples must lead his or her\nfollowers by word and example to become like Jesus. Ultimately, we are not\ncalled to make people our disciples but to make them disciples of Jesus.\nMark\u2019s gospel clearly reveals Jesus\u2019 method of discipling: \u201cAnd He went\nup on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they\ncame to Him. Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and\n\nthat He might send them out to preach, and to have power to heal sicknesses\nand to cast out demons\u2026\u201d (Mark 3:13-15). In this passage, Mark lists three\naspects of making disciples: (1) \u201cthat they might be with Him\u201d (learning by\nexample), (2) \u201cthat He might send them out to preach\u201d (learning to commu-\nnicate), and (3) \u201cand to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons\u201d\n(learning to minister). None of these aspects can be learned by mere verbal\ninstruction. Pupils must receive the same anointing of the Holy Spirit that\nenlivens their teachers just as Elisha took upon himself the mantle of Elijah\n(1 Kings 19:19; 2 Kings 2:14). The word \u201cdisciple\u201d was the first name given\nto the early Christians (Acts 11:26). Love is the crowning virtue that charac-\nterizes an individual as a disciple of Jesus (John 13:35; see also: Mark 8:34;\nLuke 5:11, 27-28; John 1:43; 21:19-22; 1 Thess. 1:6-7; 1 Tim. 1:16; 4:12;\nTitus 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:21; 5:3).\nG. The church as servant or steward\nThe principal words of church life are servanthood words: \u201cminister\u201d or\n\u201cministry\u201d from the Greek diakonos; diakonia meaning \u201cservant, service or\none who serves tables\u201d (John 12:26); \u201cservant\u201d from doulos, meaning \u201cslave\u201d\n(Matt. 24:45; 25:14; Gal. 5:13); and \u201csteward\u201d from oikonomos, \u201cthe servant\nwho administered the household\u201d (Luke 12:42; 1 Cor. 4:1-2; Titus 1:7; 1 Pet.\n4:10). Two other words translated \u201cminister\u201d are huperetes, which originally\nmeant \u201ca servant who rowed a ship\u201d (Acts 13:5), and leitourgos, meaning a\n\u201cpublic servant\u201d who served the community at his own expense (Rom. 15:16).\nWords expressing servanthood are used throughout the New Testament.\nThe following examples demonstrate that all Christian officers, ministers,\nworkers and leaders are called to be servants:\n(1) Jesus assumed the place of a servant (Matt. 20:27-28; Mark 10:42-45).\n(2) The spirit of the world seeks to exploit and dominate others; Jesus\ntaught His followers to serve one another (1 Pet. 5:3; 1 Cor. 9:19; Gal. 5:13;\nLuke 22:24-28).\n\n(3) Believers will give an account of the stewardship of their service\n(Matt. 25:14-30). The greatest virtue in stewards is that they be found\nfaithful (1 Cor. 4:1-2; Matt. 25:21).\n(4) Believers are to submit to one another and to esteem very highly\nthose who are placed over them in the Lord (Eph. 5:21; 1 Thess. 5:12).\nFurthermore, leadership and guidance are ministries in themselves (Acts\n20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2-3; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24).\n(5) Paul, who had apostolic authority, called himself \u201ca bondservant of\nJesus Christ\u201d (Rom. 1:1).\n(6) All believers are charged to be equipped \u201cfor the work of ministry,\u201d\nthat is, to serve one another (Eph. 4:12).\nH. The church as a spiritual building or sanctuary\nThe metaphor of the church as a spiritual building or sanctuary is sug-\ngested in the following passages: 1 Cor. 3:9-16; Eph. 2:19-22; Matt. 16:18;\n21:42; 1 Pet. 2:4-7; Luke 6:46-49; Acts 4:11; 17:24; Rom. 15:20; 1 Kings.\n8:27; Isa. 66:1-2; Ps. 118:22. These passages teach the following principles:\n(1) The Lord does not abide in buildings made with hands but in His\npeople as a church (Acts 17:24; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Kings 8:27; Isa. 66:1-2).\n(2) The church is the Lord\u2019s sanctuary, and He dwells where His people\nare gathered together in His name (Matt. 18:20).\n(3) The physical temple was a sanctuary; a holy, separated building that\nwas dedicated exclusively to the worship and service of God. Likewise, the\nNew Testament church is a temple or sanctuary of the Holy Spirit where the\nLord dwells. The members of that sanctuary or church are called \u201csaints\u201d or\n\u201choly ones\u201d (1 Cor. 3:17; Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-5).\n\n(4) Christ is the foundation and the \u201cchief cornerstone\u201d of the church.\nPsalm 118:22 is found five times in the New Testament: \u201cThe stone which\nthe builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone\u2026\u201d (1 Pet. 2:7; Matt.\n21:42; Mark 12:10-11; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; see also Isa. 8:14; 28:16; Dan.\n2:34-35; Rom. 9:32-33).\n(5) Believers are the building materials or \u201cliving stones\u201d (1 Pet. 2:5).\n(6) Ministers are said to be builders, Christ being the master builder and\narchitect (Matt 16:18).\n(7) There are no isolated stones; all are built into the building (Eph.\n2:20-22).\n(8) Believers must take heed as to what kinds of materials they are and\nhow they build (1 Cor. 3:9-16).\nI. The church as a mystery\nOne of Paul\u2019s strongest concepts of the church was that of the church\nas \u201cmystery.\u201d The Bible word mystery has a different meaning from that\nattached to it in modern English. In modern usage, mystery means some-\nthing is difficult to understand. In ancient Greece, mysteries referred to the\nsecrets of the mystery religions revealed only to individuals initiated into\nthose religions. The secrets were not mysterious because they were hard to\nunderstand but because they were hidden. Once a person was initiated into\nthe mystery religion, that person could clearly comprehend the secrets. In this\nsense, Paul spoke of the \u201cmystery of Christ\u201d and the revelation of the good\nnews of the gospel for all people. A mystery that \u201cin other ages was not made\nknown to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His\nholy apostles and prophets\u2026\u201d (Eph. 3:5). One of the mysteries revealed in\nChrist is the church, which was not fully understood in the Old Testament.\nThe prophets predicted that God would bless the Gentiles, but they did not\nfully express how the Gentile believers would share equally with Israel in the\nbody of Christ.\n\n\u201cThe Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body and fellow\npartakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel\u201d (Eph. 3:4-6,\nNASB; Col. 1:25-27). Paul considered that God had given him a special\nministry to declare the doctrine of the church as mystery (Eph. 3:3-4). The\nwonder of this mystery is the truth and fact of \u201cChrist in you, the hope of\nglory\u201d (Col. 1:27).\nJ. The church as the Lord\u2019s field\nThe Bible frequently employs agricultural metaphors. Paul wrote to\nthe Corinthian church: \u201c\u2026you are God\u2019s field\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 3:6-9). In God\u2019s\nfield (the church) there are planters, cultivators and reapers, but God gives\nthe increase. Workers must not quarrel over their relative importance; God\ncalls and places each person in his or her divinely determined office. The\nworkers are indispensible, but the divine \u201cvinedresser\u201d gives the vine life and\ngrowth (John 15:1-2). Diligent work in God\u2019s field brings reward. Paul wrote\nto Timothy: \u201cThe hardworking farmer ought to be the first to receive his\nshare of the crops\u201d (2 Tim. 2:6, NASB). The agricultural parables in Matthew\nChapter Thirteen speak of the seed (the word), different soils (hearers of the\nword) and varying degrees of yield: thirty, sixty and one hundred fold (Matt.\n13:3-8, 18-23).\nK. The church as a royal priesthood\nPeter introduced the metaphor of the church as a royal priesthood:\nYou... are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priest-\nhood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God\nthrough Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 2:5).\nBut you are a chosen generation [race], a royal priesthood,\na holy nation, His own special people, that you may pro-\nclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness\ninto His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9).\n\nIn the Old Testament sense, the church no longer needs priests to offer\nup animal sacrifices. Christ Jesus made the once-and-for-all perfect, atoning\nsacrifice of Himself for our redemption. The church, however, still offers up\n\u201cspiritual sacrifices\u201d of praise, worship and thanksgiving to God (Heb. 13:15).\nThe church also intercedes and prays for rulers and all people (1 Tim. 2:1-4).\nOne of the great truths of the church is the \u201cpriesthood of all believers.\u201d\nEvery believer in Christ has access to the throne of God by the merits of Jesus:\n\u201cFor through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father\u201d (Eph.\n2:14-18; see also Heb. 4:14-16).\nAs priests, believers have been given the ministry of reconciliation:\n\u201cGod\u2026has given us the ministry of reconciliation\u2026and has committed to\nus the word of reconciliation. Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as\nthough God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ\u2019s behalf, be\nreconciled to God\u201d (2 Cor. 5:18-20). In consecration, the believer offers him-\nself to God as a \u201cliving sacrifice,\u201d holy and acceptable (Rom. 12:1). Other sac-\nrifices that the believer offers to God are \u201cbrotherly love\u201d (Eph. 5:1-2), \u201cgood\nworks\u201d (Heb. 13:16), \u201cmaterial possessions\u201d to assist others (Heb. 13:16) and\n\u201cministry\u201d for others (Phil. 2:17).\nL. The church as the bride of Christ\nOne of the most attractive metaphors of the community of God is the\nchurch as the bride of Christ. This metaphor is used by John the Baptist\n(John 3:29), the apostle Paul (1 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:21-32) and the apostle\nJohn (Rev. 19:7-9). There is a strong relationship between the bride of Christ\nmetaphor and that of the church as the body of Christ. The analogy of the\nchurch as Christ\u2019s bride has the following applications:\n(1) Viewing the church as the bride of Christ provides a pattern for rela-\ntionship between husbands and wives.\n(2) A wife is to be in submission to her husband as the church is to Christ,\nand as believers submit one to another (Eph. 5:21-22), not because she is\n\ninferior, less worthy or less capable. A husband is to lovingly bear the respon-\nsibility of spiritual leadership with the indispensible support of his wife.\n(3) A husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the church. He is to love\nhis wife as much as he loves himself, even enough to die for her (Eph. 5:25-\n29). If both wives and husbands comply with the pattern of biblical submis-\nsion and love, no one is disadvantaged in the marriage relationship.\n(4) This figure portrays the great love Christ has for His church as His\nown bride and the love the church experiences waiting for the coming of\nthe bridegroom.\nM. The church as the Lord\u2019s embassy\nPaul calls himself the Lord\u2019s ambassador: \u201c\u2026I am an ambassador in\nchains\u2026\u201d (Eph. 6:20). He also includes believers with himself in this ambas-\nsadorship, \u201cNow then, we are ambassadors for Christ\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 5:20).\nSeveral observations may be made from this truth. First, we are the ambassa-\ndors of our king, who dispatches us on a divine mission of peace. Second, as\nambassadors of His sovereign \u201cterms\u201d for peace (Luke 14:31-32), the church\nannounces to the world the terms for reconciling to God: every person must\nhave faith in Christ, and every person must surrender to Him as Lord. The\nLord has given to the church the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor. 5:18-21).\nN. The church as the pillar and ground of truth\nThe church supports the truth of the gospel and lifts that truth on high.\nPaul wrote to Timothy concerning the church: \u201c\u2026but in case I am delayed, I\nwrite so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house-\nhold of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of\nthe truth\u201d (1 Tim. 3:15, NASB). In the following verse, Paul used what may\nhave been a poetic, doctrinal expression to refer to an aspect of this truth as\nthe \u201cmystery of godliness,\u201d a phrase widely used in the early church (v. 16).\nThe church is to safeguard sound doctrine and to lift truth on high by the\nproclamation of the gospel and by exemplary conduct.\n\nO. The church as pilgrims\nThis metaphor defines the church\u2019s relationship to this present world\nwith the following applications: (1) believers are not really \u201cat home\u201d in this\nworld, nor are they to be \u201cconformed to this world\u201d because their true citi-\nzenship is in heaven (Phil. 3:20; Rom. 12:2); (2) believers sojourn here as pil-\ngrims and strangers (Heb. 11:13); (3) though they are pilgrims, believers are\ncommissioned to witness to this world and to win from the world citizens for\nChrist\u2019s kingdom (1 Pet. 2:11-12; Col. 1:12-14; Acts 1:8); (4) every believer\u2019s\ngoal is to live for the coming city of God: \u201cFor here we have no continuing\ncity, but we seek one to come\u201d (Heb. 13:14).\nP. The church as the Way\nIn the book of Acts, the life of the church is called \u201cthe Way\u201d and believ-\ners are called \u201cthose of the Way\u201d: \u201c\u2026and asked letters from him to the syna-\ngogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether\nmen or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem\u201d (Acts 9:2). The\nchurch as the body of Christ is the Way, for Christ is \u201cthe Way, the truth,\nand the life. No one comes to the Father except [by Him]\u201d (John 14:6). The\nfollowing truths are stated about the Way in the book of Acts: (1) the Way of\nGod was persecuted (22:4); (2) people spoke evil of the Way (19:9); (3) the\nWay was called a heretical sect (24:14); (4) Paul confessed joyfully to Felix\nthat he was of that Way (24:14); (5) the Way was a disturbing element in a\nsociety ruled over by the powers of darkness (19:23).\nQ. The church as the Lord\u2019s inheritance\nIn the first chapter of Ephesians, Paul makes the remarkable statement:\n\u201c\u2026that you may know what is\u2026the glory of His inheritance in the saints\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 1:18). This is often interpreted to refer to our inheritance, but a care-\nful reading shows that the verse refers to the Lord\u2019s inheritance, which is the\nsaints or the church. In verses eleven and fourteen, the same truth is found.\nAlthough the New King James Version renders verse eleven: \u201cIn Him also\nwe have obtained an inheritance,\u201d the Revised Version reads: \u201cIn whom we\nwere made a heritage.\u201d The renowned Greek scholar B.F. Wescott translates\n\nEphesians 1:11a: \u201cWe were also made God\u2019s portion.\u201d2 The Living Bible ren-\nders verse eleven: \u201cBecause of what Christ has done we have become gifts to\nGod that He delights in.\u201d F.F. Bruce, commenting on the Revised Version\u2019s\ntranslation of verse eleven wrote:\n\u201cIn whom we were made a heritage\u201d\u2014This is a preferable ren-\ndering to that of A.V. \u201cin whom we have obtained an inheri-\ntance.\u201d Both statements are true, but the apostle is thinking here\nof \u201cGod\u2019s own possession\u201d (v. 14), \u201cHis inheritance in the saints\u201d\n(v. 18). So, in Old Testament days, it was revealed that the Lord\u2019s\nportion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance (Deut.\n32:9). In Christ, then, we have been admitted to the ranks of the\nchosen people, the holy heritage of God3 (see also 1 Pet. 2:9-10;\nExod. 19:5-6; Deut. 14:2; 32:9; Ps. 72:2; Mal. 3:17).\nR. The church as the Lord\u2019s masterpiece\nSince Ephesians is the epistle about the church, many of the metaphors\nfor the church are found in Ephesians. In Ephesians Chapter Two, Paul states,\n\u201cFor we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works\u2026\u201d\n(Eph. 2:10a). The Greek word translated \u201cworkmanship\u201d is poiema, meaning\na \u201cpiece of workmanship, a creation.\u201d Poiema is the word from which we get\nthe English word \u201cpoem.\u201d The church is God\u2019s masterpiece of creation. God\ncreated the church for good works. A perfected church portrays Jesus Christ\nthe Lord: \u201c\u2026when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him\nas He is (1 John 3:2). All the pronouns in Ephesians Chapter Two are plural:\n\u201cWe are God\u2019s workmanship.\u201d The church is God\u2019s masterpiece, a mosaic of\nall His people in a designed collective work (see Phil. 1:6; 2:13; Eph. 3:10;\nCol. 1:28-29; Heb. 13:21; 2 Cor. 5:17).\nS. The church as the light of the world\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, \u201cYou are the light of the world. A\ncity that is set on a hill cannot be hidden\u201d (Matt. 5:14). The figure of the church\n2 Brook Foss Westcott, Saint Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Ephesians (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 1979) 14.\n3 Frederick Fyvie Bruce, The Epistle to the Ephesians (Westwood, NJ: Fleming H. Revell Publishing Company,\n1961) 33.\n\nas light suggests the following: (1) believers are the children of light and give\nwitness to Christ who is the true light of the world (John 8:12); (2) believers\nreflect the light of Christ like the light of the moon as Christ shines on us (Eph.\n5:14, NIV); (3) the book of Revelation calls local churches \u201clampstands\u201d (Rev.\n1:20); (4) no matter how blessed we are to minister one to another, believers\nmust not forget their primary mission is illuminating the darkness of the world\n(Matt. 5:16); (5) believers witness through words and works (1 Pet. 2:12).\nT. The church as the salt of the earth\nWhat did Jesus mean when He said, \u201cYou are the salt of the earth?\u201d\n(Matt. 5:13). The following applications seem to be indicated:\n(1) Salt preserves: the church preserves and reinforces the qualities of\ngoodness, honor, justice and mercy in a society.\n(2) Salt inhibits corruption: the church restrains corrupting influences;\nthe good works of the church rebuke evil.\n(3) Salt gives zest and flavor: the church gives a zest and distinctive flavor\nto its surroundings. The church is not told to be the \u201csugar of the earth\u201d but\nthe salt of the earth, and believers are warned not to lose this savor. Savorless\nsalt is \u201c\u2026good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by\nmen\u201d (Matt. 5:13).\n(4) The church must maintain its saltiness: the church is not only to\n\u201csalt\u201d the world but to keep its saltiness to restrain selfish ambition and quar-\nrelsomeness (Mark 9:49-50; Luke 14:33).\n(5) Salt is impactful: Paul seems to interpret \u201csalt\u201d to mean \u201cwisdom\u201d or\nspiritual \u201czest\u201d in communication, speech that is not dull or insipid (Col. 4:6).\nU. The church as fishers of men\nJesus said to His disciples, \u201cFollow Me, and I will make you become\nfishers of men\u201d (Mark 1:17; see Matt 4:18-20). This imagery derives from the\n\nfirst disciples being fishermen. Jesus employed a ready metaphor and called\nthem to become fishers of men. The church is commissioned to catch people\nfor Christ\u2019s kingdom. In Luke 5:10, the words \u201ccatch men\u201d mean literally to\n\u201ctake men alive.\u201d People caught for Christ receive a new quality of life. If the\nchurch does not catch people for Christ, Satan will snare them (2 Tim. 2:25-\n26). The implication of becoming \u201cfishers of men\u201d is that Christians must be\nintentional in reaching the unsaved with the gospel.\nV. The church as a crucible\nThe life of the church is a life of faith. Genuine faith will be tested.\nGod lets our faith be tested and tried so that He may approve it. God can\nbless faith that has been proved genuine through testing. In 1 Peter 1:6-7,\nthe phrase \u201cthe trial of your faith\u201d is literally \u201cthe approval [by trial] of your\nfaith.\u201d The Greek word for \u201ctrial\u201d is dokime, a term related to an assayer, a\nperson who tests and approves precious metal. The testing and approval of\nthe believer\u2019s faith is said to be more precious than the testing and approval of\ngold. Like gold, faith must be put in the crucible to be proved and purged by\nthe fire (1 Pet. 4:12-17; James 1:3).\nMany areas of Christian fellowship test the faith of believers such as lov-\ning the brethren, walking in faith and obedience, submitting to Christ and to\none another and drawing upon the ministry of the word in times of adversity\n(Prov. 17:3; 27:21). Peter declared that judgment begins at the household of\nGod (1 Pet. 4:17). The Greek words: dokime, dokimazo, dokimos and dokim-\nion (used thirty-nine times in the New Testament) are words describing the\nwork of the assayer with his crucible. In the life of the church, believers are in\nGod\u2019s crucible, being tested and approved (see 1 Thess. 2:4; Rom. 16:10;\n1 Cor. 3:13; 2 Cor. 10:18; James 1:12).\nW. The church as the wild olive branch\nThe church as a wild olive branch has been grafted into the tree of God\u2019s\nredeeming purpose, replacing rebellious Israel. This is not, however, a perma-\nnent displacement. When the church has been completed, God will yet deal\n\nwith and fulfill His promises to the remnant of national Israel (Rom. 11:16-\n24; Jer. 11:16-17).\nThe many metaphors used to describe the church demonstrate the\nimportance of the church in God\u2019s plan for humanity. Ultimately, God has\nestablished and ordained the church for Spirit-filled worship; the preaching\nand teaching of the gospel; the advancement of the Great Commission; and\nthe nurturing of believers. The church is the body of Jesus Christ. Through\nthe church, Christ is still ministering and advancing the kingdom of God.\nThe Bible always refers to the church not as a building, but as a people set\napart by God. Each person is called to participate within the church for the\nglory of God and the edification of the larger body of believers. When indi-\nviduals embrace a healthy theology of the church, they vibrantly express the\nindividual and community transforming power of the gospel."};
