Even the psalm-\nist noted, \u201cWhat is man that You are mindful of him?\u201d (Ps. 8:4). However,\nwhen we realize humans are a creation of God (Gen. 1:27), that redeemed\npeople are God\u2019s handiwork (Eph. 2:10, WNT) and that redeemed human-\nity is God\u2019s inheritance (Eph. 1:18), we become aware of the importance of\nstudying the doctrine of humankind.\nRenowned scholar Carl F. H. Henry wrote: \u201cWho is man? This remarkable\ncreature, whose amazing conquest of space and time has yielded unabridged\ndictionaries indexing the whole of reality, has fallen into frustration\u2014ironi-\ncally enough\u2014when defining himself.\u201d16\nOnly Scripture gives a solid and satisfying answer to the age-long question,\n\u201cWho is the human being?\u201d Therefore, any serious work on Bible doctrine must\n16 Everett F. Harrison. ed. Baker\u2019s Dictionary of Theology (Grand Rapids. MI: Baker Book House, 1960) 338.\n\ncope with the question of humanity. Anthropology is the study of humankind\nderived from the Greek words: anthropos, meaning human, and logos, meaning\ndiscourse or reason. Biblical anthropology deals with humans as God\u2019s creation\nalienated from God by their voluntary disobedience, yet reconciled to God\nthrough His redeeming grace. According to Merriam-Webster, anthropology\nin a religious context is the study of \u201ctheology dealing with the origin, nature,\nand destiny of human beings.\u201d17 This text will deal with anthropology and the\ndoctrine of humankind from a scriptural perspective.\nThe psalmist asked, \u201cWhat is man that You are mindful of him?\u201d He\nanswered, \u201cFor You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You\nhave crowned him with glory and honor. You have made him to have domin-\nion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet\u2026\u201d\n(Ps. 8:5-6). However, in the course of time, all humans have disobeyed and\nfallen \u201cshort of the glory of God\u201d (Rom. 3:23). The writer of Hebrews quoted\nPsalm 8:4-6 and added: \u201cBut now we do not yet see all things put under him.\nBut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffer-\ning of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God,\nmight taste death for everyone\u201d (Heb. 2:8b-9). This is the good news of God\u2019s\nredemptive relationship with humanity.\nTo better understand the doctrine of humankind, this chapter will\naddress the following major categories: (1) God created people, (2) people\nare the result of God\u2019s purpose, (3) people are created in God\u2019s image and (4)\npeople are created as living souls. We will also look at (5) the original state of\nhumans, (6) the fall of humankind and (7) humankind\u2019s state of grace.\nI. Created by God\nA. Humans did not evolve from lower life forms\nThe Bible attributes the origin of humans to an act of direct creation\nby God: \u201cSo God created man in His own image\u2026\u201d (Gen. 1:27). \u201cAnd the\n17 Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition (2001). Merriam-Webster.\n\nLord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his\nnostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being\u201d (Gen. 2:7). Many\nwithin the public school system and scientific community teach that humans\nevolved from lower animals and that life over a vast expanse of time came\nfrom a single life form with an unknown origin. Some teachers and scientists\nacknowledge that evolution is, in fact, only a theory or hypothesis advanced\nto explain origins without supernatural cause. The theory of evolution is\ngenerally attributed to Charles Darwin, who first popularized the hypothesis\nin the middle of the 19th century. Materialists enthusiastically received the\ntheory because it seemed to contradict Mendel\u2019s law of heredity, i.e. that spe-\ncies are unchangeable and that species do not inherit acquired characteristics.\nLater, scientists gave the name \u201cgenes\u201d to the remarkable factors that control\nheredity. Kofahl explained:\nResearch over the past two decades has revealed much\nabout the structure of the gene. A great deal has been\nlearned about the function of the gene at the molecular\nlevel. Molecular genetics is a most complicated subject\nwhich affords powerful support for the Biblical cre-\nation model.1\nPaul Brand, once a renowned surgeon and former chief of the rehabil-\nitation branch of the United States Public Health Service, pointed out that\nthe genetic, chemical code DNA controls all forms of life, maintaining the\nspecies propagating \u201ceach after its own kind\u201d according to Genesis 1 and pre-\nventing the evolution of any species into another. Brand wrote:\nAll living matter is basically alike; a single atom differ-\nentiates animal blood from plant chlorophyll. Yet the\nbody senses infinitesimal differences with an unfailing\nscent; it knows its hundred trillion cells by name ... To\ncomplicate the process of identity, the composite of Paul\nBrand\u2014bone cells, fat cells, blood cells, muscle cells\u2014\ndiffers entirely from my components ten years ago. All\n1 Robert E. Kofahl and K.L. Seagrave, The Creation Explanation (Wheaton, ILL: Harold Shaw Publishers,\n1975) 78.\n\ncells have been replaced by new cells (except for nerve\ncells and brain cells, which are never replaced). Thus, my\nbody is more like a fountain than a sculpture: maintain-\ning its shape, but constantly being renewed. Somehow,\nmy body knows the new cells belong, and they are wel-\ncomed. What moves the cells to work together? ... The\nsecret to membership lies locked away inside each cell\nnucleus, chemically coiled in a strand of DNA. Once the\negg and sperm share their inheritance, the DNA chem-\nical ladder splits down the center of every gene much as\nthe teeth of a zipper pull apart. DNA reforms itself each\ntime the cell divides: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 cells, each with the\nidentical DNA. Along the way cells specialize, but each\ncarries the entire instruction book of one hundred thou-\nsand genes. DNA is estimated to contain instructions\nthat, if written out, would fill a thousand, six hundred\npage books ... (The DNA is so narrow and compacted\nthat all the genes in all my body\u2019s cells would fit into\nan ice cube; yet if DNA were unwound and joined\ntogether end to end, the strand could stretch from earth\nto the sun and back more than four hundred times) ...\nA nerve cell may operate according to instructions from\nvolume four and a kidney cell from volume twenty-five,\nbut both carry the whole compendium. It provides each\ncell\u2019s sealed credential of membership in the body. Every\ncell possesses a genetic code so complete that the entire\nbody could be reassembled from the information in any\none of the body\u2019s cells ... The Designer of DNA went\non to challenge the human race to a new and higher\npurpose: membership in His own Body ... In reality, I\nbecome genetically like Christ Himself because I belong\nto His body.2\n2 Paul Brand and Philip Yancy, Fearfully and Wonderfully Made (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing\nHouse, 1981) 44-46.\n\nMendel\u2019s law seemed to sound a death knell for Darwin\u2019s theory.\nHowever, persistent evolutionists found a new basis for evolution in the\nstudy of the occasional sudden changes in life forms known as mutations.\nWhile nearly all mutations are harmful, some scientists theorize that benefi-\ncial mutations could account for the ongoing evolution from lower species to\nhigher species even though no real world evidence for beneficial mutations\nexists. Some in the scientific community have labeled evolution by mutations\n\u201cneoDarwinism.\u201d\nNevertheless, the framework of evolutionary theory comes under criti-\ncism. Francis Hitchings, writing in Life Magazine stated, \u201cCharles Darwin\ndied 100 years ago\u2026today his explanation of evolution is being challenged as\nnever before, not just by creationists, but by his fellow scientists.\u201d3\nWhile many scientists work on the assumption of the evolutionary\nhypothesis, evolution is not provable using the scientific method. There is\noverwhelming logic in a supernatural origin for humans, who almost univer-\nsally seek an object of worship, and who cannot escape from an instinct of\nresponsibility to a higher power. One hundred years beyond Darwin, evolu-\ntion is still unproven and contributes nothing to the dignity of humanness. It\nis ultimately a godless faith.\nNot all evolutionists are materialists or agnostics. Theistic evolutionists\nhold that evolution is the method God employed to create life. However, no\ncorroborating evidence exists either in the fossil record or in the science of\ngenetics for the transmutation of species. Since the Bible plainly states that\nthe species propagate, each one after its own kind, it seems truer to Scripture\nand to reason to accept a direct creation for man and woman as a natural\ninterpretation of the Genesis creation narrative.\nConversely, Bible believers cannot scientifically affirm many aspects of\nthe divine creation (creationism). Instead, they must accept the account of\nScripture by faith. Accepting the Lord of the Scripture by faith transforms the\n3 Francis Hitchings, \u201cWas Darwin Wrong?\u201d Life Magazine (April 1982), quoted from Francis Hitchings\nThe Neck of the Giraffe: Where Darwin Went Wrong (New York: Ticknor and Fields, 1982).\n\nlife of individuals and provides a sustaining hope and a powerful meaning to\nexistence. Indeed, courageous faith will inform all believers of their meaning-\nful origin and heavenly destiny.\nWhile the believer\u2019s ultimate acceptance of divine origin is an act of faith,\nat the same time, divine origin is not without solid scientific evidence:\nThe most powerful evidence for creation and against\nevolution is, in our opinion, to be found in specific evi-\ndences of intelligent, purposeful design. This evidence\nis all around us and is something the layman as well as\nthe scientist can appreciate. The authors of The Creation\nExplanation accept the claim of the Bible to be the Word\nof God. They accept the opening chapters of Genesis,\ntherefore, to be true to scientific fact. This is their fun-\ndamental postulate and they make no apology for it.4\nB. Humans exist by special creation\nThree Hebrew words are used in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 to describe\nhuman creation: (1) bara, which means \u201cthe production or effectuation of\nsomething new, rare and wonderful,\u201d (2) asah, which means \u201cto form, to con-\nstruct, to prepare, to build\u201d and (3) yatzar, which means \u201cto form or shape\u201d\n(as a potter forming vessels). According to Genesis 1:26, the triune God said,\n\u201cLet us make man\u201d (asah); in Genesis 1:27 we read, \u201cSo God created man\u201d\n(bara); Genesis 2:7 states, \u201cAnd the Lord God formed man\u201d (yatzar). The idea\nin 1:26 is that God constructed people in conformity with His own image;\nin 1:27 He created humans as something new and wonderful in His purpose,\nand in 2:7 He formed and shaped the human body from the earth as a potter\nforms a vessel of clay. The \u201cdust of the ground\u201d (2:7) identifies human beings\nwith the scene of both their fall and redemption. The breath of God identifies\nhumans as having a God-given origin and a heavenly destination. Men and\nwomen are of the earth but intended for fellowship with God.\n4 Kofahl, xii, xiii.\n\nThe declaration of human creation by God is affirmed and assumed\nthroughout Scripture. Genesis 5:1b and Genesis 5:2a continue: \u201cIn the day\nthat God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. He created them\nmale and female\u2026\u201d Genesis 6:7 states, \u201cSo the LORD said, \u2018I will destroy\nman whom I have created bara\u2026\u2019\u201d Moses says in Deuteronomy 4:32, con-\ncerning the miraculous deliverance from Egypt: \u201cFor ask now concerning the\ndays that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man\non the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether any great\nthing like this has happened\u2026\u201d The prophet Isaiah was inspired to write the\nfollowing statements: \u201cBut now, thus says the LORD, who created you\u2026\u201d\n(Isa. 43:1). \u201cEveryone who is called by My name, Whom I have created for\nMy glory; I have formed him, yes, I have made him\u201d (Isa. 43:7). \u201cI have made\nthe earth, And created man on it\u2026\u201d (Isa. 45:12). Malachi states: \u201cHave we\nnot all one Father? Has not one God created us?\u201d (Mal. 2:10a).\nThe New Testament writers clearly affirmed that God created people.\nThe apostle Paul confirmed that believers \u201c\u2026have put on the new man, who\nis renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him\u2026\u201d\n(Col. 3:10; see also Rom. 9:20; 1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Tim. 2:13; Jas. 3:9).\nII. The Result of God\u2019s Purpose\nA. The council of the Trinity\nGod did not create human beings in the same way He created animals.\nAnimals were created as a result of God\u2019s spoken command. God formed the\nfirst man (Adam) out of the earth and breathed His divine breath into him.\nThere was something from God Himself breathed into Adam, demonstrating\nthat Adam was unique to God above all other creatures of the world. Isaiah\nexplained God\u2019s purpose: \u201cEveryone who is called by My name, Whom I\nhave created for My glory; I have formed him, yes, I have made him\u201d (Isa.\n43:7). Humanity is the product of God\u2019s planned purpose to create a being\nto glorify Him.\n\nThe deliberate affirmation of Genesis 1:26 hints of the council of the\nTrinity when God says, \u201cLet Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness,\nand let them have dominion ... over all the earth.\u201d Some have attributed the\nplural pronouns \u201cUs\u201d and \u201cOur\u201d to the fact that the name for God (Elohim)\nis a plural form. However, Elohim, while it is plural, usually takes a singular\nverb. Commenting on Genesis 1:26, H. C. Leupold stated:\nThe hortative, \u201cLet us make\u201d [na\u2019aseh], is particularly\nstriking because it is plural\u2026Behind such speaking lies\nthe truth of the Holy Trinity which, as it grows increas-\ningly clear in revelation, is in the light of later clear reve-\nlation discovered as contained in this plural in a kind of\nobscure adumbration. The truth of the Trinity explains\nthis passage. The common explanation that God is\naddressing the angels has been shown up in its deficien-\ncies by Koenig. It cannot be denied that on occasion\nGod addressed the angelic host before His throne\u2026but\nnever once does God actually counsel with them.5\nB. The work of God\u2019s creative purpose\nPaul referred to this council of the triune God in Ephesians 1:4 when he\nwrote: \u201c\u2026just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that\nwe should be holy and without blame before Him in love\u2026\u201d In 2 Timothy\n1:9, Paul stated that it is God \u201cwho has saved us and called us with a holy\ncalling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and\ngrace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began\u2026\u201d The Word\nestablishes the following facts concerning human creation:\nGod created people.\n1. Of all created beings, only humans received the breath of God.\n2. God formed humans in His own image.\n5 Carl Leupold, Exposition of Genesis (Columbus, OH: The Wartburg Press, 1942) 86-87.\n\n3. God created people for His glory.\n4. Humanity was planned and designed in the council of the triune God.\n5. Jesus Christ, by becoming human, redeemed humankind.\nWriting to Titus, Paul declared: \u201c\u2026in hope of eternal life which God,\nwho cannot lie, promised before time began\u2026\u201d (Tit. 1:2). Since God could\nnot have made a promise to a person before time began, He must have made\nthe promise to His Son, Jesus, regarding the redemption and eternal life of\npeople. Jesus, in His intercessory prayer to the Father clearly implied this\ntruth, \u201cFather, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me\nwhere I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for\nYou loved Me before the foundation of the world\u201d (John 17:24).\nSome have asked, \u201cIf God in His foreknowledge knew Adam would\nfall, why did He create him?\u201d We cannot discern God\u2019s motives, but we\ncan be certain it was always God\u2019s divine purpose that redeemed humans,\nmade in His image, would bring glory to His name. Although no one can\ncompletely fathom the mysteries of God, it is clear that the redeemed in\nChrist, the object of God\u2019s love, fulfill a high purpose. Humans are more\nthan the \u201cdust of the ground\u201d; they have the potential to become redeemed\nchildren of God.\nIII. Created in God\u2019s Image\nThe Scripture tells us God created people in His own image. In Hebrew\nthe term is tselem Elohim, in Greek it is eikon tou Theou, and in Latin it is\nimago Dei. Scripture does not explicitly define what it means to be made in\nGod\u2019s image. Consequently, many explanations have been offered. The fol-\nlowing are common interpretations of the imago Dei.\nA. Not a physical image\nGod is Spirit. He does not have a physical body (John 4:24). He is invis-\nible (Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17; Heb. 11:27) although He may appear in human\n\nform as in the case of the angel of Yahweh (Gen. 17-18). Some conjecture\nthat the upright stature of people indicates patterning after a prototype image\nrepresented by the glorified body of Christ. Romans 5:14 states that Adam\nwas a type of Christ. However, the Pentateuch expressly prohibited Israel\nfrom making any graven image of God in human form. It is true that Jesus\nsubsisted in the \u201cform of God\u201d; however, when He came to earth, He took\nthe form of a servant and became like a man in appearance. In fact, Jesus\u2019\nearthly form must have been a great condescension from His heavenly form\n(Phil. 2:7-8). In spite of the Fall, it is still true that humans are made in the\nimage of God (Gen. 9:6; Isa. 6:1; Jas. 3:9; John 5:37).\nB. A personal image\nGod is a personal God: One who designs, plans, communicates, wills and\nfeels (is pleased and displeased). Personality comprises the intellect, emotion\nand will. Genesis 1:26-31 attributes these personality components to God:\nintellect in the words \u201cand God said\u201d; will and purpose in the statement \u201cLet\nUs make\u201d; and feeling or emotion in the sentence \u201cThen God saw every-\nthing that He had made, and indeed it was very good.\u201d God\u2019s nature is vastly\nbeyond human comprehension, but the infinite God represents Himself\nthroughout the Scripture as possessing personal characteristics.\nIf God had a purpose in creating people, He must have desired to com-\nmunicate with His creation to reveal something of His will and purpose.\nThe God who said, \u201clet Us make\u201d also said to His nation Israel, \u201cCome now,\nand let us reason together\u2026\u201d (Isa. 1:18). Humans are the only earthly crea-\ntures able to reason abstractly, create, innovate and choose with free agency to\ncommunicate with and worship God. Animal activity, on the other hand, is\nmostly instinctive, lacking freedom and volition. Do the personal and ratio-\nnal faculties of humans constitute God\u2019s image? Or does the capacity of peo-\nple to have dominion and to rule over the earth\u2019s creatures, making animals\nserve them, constitute the divine image? Is the image of God seen in human-\nkind\u2019s exploration of space or the harnessing of nuclear energy, electricity and\nother natural forces? There seems to be some hint of this in Genesis 1:28-31\nand Psalm 8:4-9.\n\nC. A moral image\nHuman beings are moral beings. Individuals are born with a sense of\naccountability to their Maker. When we do what is right, our hearts give us\nassurance; when we do what is wrong, our hearts condemn us (Rom. 8:1;\n1 John 3:20-21). Because humans are indeed moral creatures, God gave\nhumankind His Law, recorded in Exodus 20. God would not hold guiltless\nthose who violated the Law (Exod. 20:7). Humanity failed the test in the\nGarden. Humans also failed to keep the Law. Consequently, humans shared\nAdam\u2019s guilt as well as Adam\u2019s acquired sinful nature. Only the last Adam,\nJesus Christ, could free humans from the condemnation and guilt of their\nfallen condition (Rom. 8:1).\nAs moral beings, humans have a conscience. There are those who think\nthe conscience is not a separate faculty but merely the knowledge of self\nin relation to a known standard of right and wrong, or the interworking\nof intellect, emotion and will in the face of a moral standard. However, it\nseems clear from Scripture and experience that people do, indeed, possess\na faculty of conscience. Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary defines conscience as\n\u201cthe sense or consciousness of the moral goodness or blameworthiness of\none\u2019s own conduct, intentions, or character together with a feeling of obli-\ngation to do right or be good; a faculty, power, or principle enjoining good\nacts.\u201d6\nWhile the word conscience is not in the Old Testament, Leviticus 5:3\ndescribes the characteristics and function of the conscience. In the New\nTestament, the word conscience occurs 31 times. The scriptural record states\nthe conscience can be good, weak, pure, seared, defiled, evil and purged. The\nconscience can also bear witness and convict. Can we attribute such actions\nand characteristics to anything other than a distinct faculty? It appears the\nconscience is an instinct given to humans by God, for as soon as Adam and\nEve sinned, they hid themselves. It seems clear that the conscience interacts\nwith intellect, emotion and will.\n6 Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition (2001). Merriam-Webster.\n\nD. A social image\nGod is love. He is loving community in His essential nature, for love\nis the expression of the triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Humans\nwere created in God\u2019s image to exist in loving community. God commanded\nAdam and Eve to multiply and replenish the earth, to be a family and a family\nof nations. Likewise, God provided the Law to govern social relationships.\nSix of the Ten Commandments deal directly with how individuals should\ntreat one another. God made humans to commune with Him and with\neach other. When humankind broke communion with God, relationships\nbetween humans also broke down. Consequently, Adam and Eve\u2019s first son,\nCain, murdered their second son, Abel. Jesus taught us that love is to be the\ncontrolling motive of the redeemed; for the born again are all members of one\nbody, the Body of Christ (John 13:34-35).\nIV. Created as Living Souls\nAccording to Genesis, God gave humans two gifts at creation: (1) A\nbody formed from the dust and (2) the breath of God. \u201cAnd the LORD God\nformed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the\nbreath of life; and man became a living being\u201d (Gen. 2:7). Because of the cre-\native combination of an earthly element and a heavenly element, Adam and\nEve became living beings created in the image of their Creator. They began\nlife on the earth in vessels of clay, but their intended destiny was everlasting\nlife in a glorified body.\nA. Is given a body\nThe Greeks and many other ancients thought of the body as a prison of\nthe soul and the source of all evil. The Gnostic heresy held this low esteem\nof the body to the extreme by denying that Jesus had a physical body. To\ncounter this Gnostic teaching, the apostle John warned believers about those\nwho denied Jesus had come in the flesh (1 John 4:13). Scripture teaches us to\nhonor and respect the body as God\u2019s creation: \u201cWhoever sheds man\u2019s blood,\n\nBy man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God He made man\u201d\n(Gen. 9:6). The following are important facts concerning the body as revealed\nin Scripture:\n1. It is a mortal body that will return to the dust out of which it was fash-\nioned. God made humankind\u2019s origin very clear: \u201c... For dust you are, And to\ndust you shall return\u201d (Gen. 3:19). This thought should keep us humble in\nthe presence of our God. When Abraham talked with God, he said, \u201cIndeed\nnow, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the\nLORD\u201d (Gen. 18:27). The psalmist wrote that without the breath of God\nman is but dust, \u201c\u2026You take away their breath, they die and return to their\ndust\u201d (Ps. 104:29).\n2. Humankind is made of mere dust, but dust in the hands of God\nbecame something wonderfully made. Science continues to discover the\nunimaginably astonishing and complex workings of the human body, but\nScripture clearly shows the wonder of creation:\nI will praise You; for I am fearfully and wonderfully\nmade; Marvelous are Your works, And that my soul\nknows very well. My frame was not hidden from You,\nWhen I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in\nthe lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my sub-\nstance, being yet unformed (Ps. 139:14-16a).\n3. The natural physical body is a temporary home for the real person\nwho inhabits it. This concept is clearly taught in Scripture: \u201c\u2026knowing that\nshortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me\u201d (2\nPet. 1:14). Paul stated, \u201cFor we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is\ndestroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eter-\nnal in the heavens\u201d (2 Cor. 5:1).\n4. In the resurrection, the human body will be changed; however, the\nnew spiritual body will have a relationship to the old natural body. In regard\n\nto the resurrected body, Paul stated \u201cIt is sown a natural body, it is raised\na spiritual body\u2026For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this\nmortal must put on immortality\u201d (1 Cor. 15:44a, 53). The natural body\nthat goes back to dust will be changed supernaturally and transformed into\na glorified body. Jesus said, \u201c\u2026the dead will hear the voice of the Son of\nGod; and those who hear will live\u201d (John 5:25). Paul assured believers that\nthe dead in Christ will rise first (1 Thess. 4:16b). He further asserted that\n\u201c\u2026flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God\u201d (1 Cor. 15:50).\nHowever, just as Jesus in the resurrection had a touchable body of \u201cflesh\nand bones\u201d (Luke 24:39; John 20:27), so will the believer\u2019s resurrected body\nhave a relationship to his or her earthly body. As a new plant is related to the\nseed from which it springs, so is the resurrected body related to the natural\nbody (1 Cor. 15:44).\n5. The body of a redeemed person is a temple of the Holy Spirit; there-\nfore, it must not be used as an instrument for sin. The New Testament makes\nthis truth clear: \u201cOr do you not know that your body is the temple of the\nHoly Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your\nown? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and\nin your spirit, which are God\u2019s\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19-20).\n6. The human body when dedicated to Christ is considered a living and\nholy sacrifice. Old Testament worshipers offered dead animal sacrifices to\nGod; New Testament worshipers present their lives as living offerings of con-\nsecrated service by employing their bodies in surrendered Christian living and\nministry: \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you\npresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your\nreasonable service\u201d (Rom. 12:1).\n7. Redeemed believers may employ their bodies as weapons against Satan.\nAlthough Satan strives to motivate believers to use their bodies to advance his\ncause, Paul urged believers to use their bodies as weapons against Satan and\nfor God:\n\nYou must not let any part of your body turn into an\nunholy weapon fighting on the side of sin; you should\ninstead, offer yourselves to God, and consider your-\nselves dead men brought back to life; you should make\nevery part of your body into a weapon fighting on the\nside of God (Rom. 6:13, JB).\n8. Redeemed people enjoy many benefits of Christ\u2019s redeeming work in\ntheir present bodies. Writing about Jesus\u2019 ministry of healing, Matthew stated,\n\u201cWhen evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-pos-\nsessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: \u2018He\nHimself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses\u2019\u201d (Matt. 8:16-17).\nClearly, the work of the cross loosed the hold of sickness upon the\nphysical body. Jesus said those who preach the gospel \u201c\u2026will lay hands on\nthe sick, and they will recover\u201d (Mark 16:18). The early church believed\nChrist had ordained and empowered Christians to pray for physical healing.\nConsequently, James wrote, \u201cIs anyone among you sick? Let him call for the\nelders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil\nin the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the\nLORD will raise him up\u201d (Jas. 5:14-15a). Paul also wrote to the Romans\nconcerning how the redeeming work of Christ and the indwelling of the Holy\nSpirit bring present benefits to the body: \u201cBut if the Spirit of Him who raised\nJesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will\nalso give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you\u201d\n(Rom. 8:11). Some claim this \u201cquickening\u201d refers to the final resurrection of\nthe body; however, the following facts seem to show that Paul was writing\nabout the believer\u2019s current experience:\na) Paul was speaking of the believer\u2019s present victory over the flesh.\nb) He referred to our \u201cmortal\u201d bodies, not dead bodies; mortal means\n\u201csubject to death.\u201d\n\nc) Before the quickening of the resurrection, the bodies will be \u201cdead\u201d\nin the grave, not \u201cmortal.\u201d\nd) Romans 8:12 states: \u201cTherefore, brethren, we are debtors\u2014not to\nthe flesh, to live according to the flesh.\u201d The argument pertains clearly to\nthe present walk in the Spirit.\ne) If the Spirit delivers from carnal domination through faith, so also\ncan the Spirit deliver from bodily infirmity through faith.\n9. Each believer will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ on the basis\nof things done in the body. The Bible clearly states that the works of the body\nwill be judged: \u201cFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,\nthat each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what\nhe has done, whether good or bad\u201d (2 Cor. 5:10). The judgment (bema) is a\njudgment of works, not of condemnation (1 Cor. 3:11-15), with the degree\nof reward based upon things done \u201cin the body.\u201d It is the soul that sins but the\nbody and its members execute the sin. Paul stated: \u201cBut I discipline my body\nand bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself\nshould become disqualified\u201d (1 Cor. 9:27).\n10. People possess an inherited body of dust, bearing both the image of\nAdam and the image of God. Through Christ, we will inherit a glorified body\nin the image of Christ, the last Adam. This is made clear in Paul\u2019s writings to\nthe Corinthians:\nThe first man Adam became a living being, the last Adam\nbecame a life-giving spirit. However, the spiritual is not\nfirst, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. The first\nman was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is\nthe Lord from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are\nthose who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man,\nso also are those who are heavenly. And as we have born\nthe image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image\nof the heavenly Man (1 Cor. 15:45-49).\n\nB. Is given an immaterial life\nScripture teaches that the immaterial life and personality of every human\nare derived from God\u2019s creative breath. The life breath of every human\ndepends upon the sustaining grace of the Creator (Job 12:10; Ps. 33:6; Isa.\n42:5; Acts 17:25).\nContemporary psychology and neuroscience generally attribute human\npersonality and intellect to the physical, chemical and electrical function of\nthe brain. Some even avoid the term \u201cmind,\u201d preferring to explain human\nbehavior solely as the functioning of the brain and nervous system. This lim-\nited \u201cscientific\u201d perspective does not adequately explain the origin of life, nor\ndoes it make room for a supernatural basis for human rationality.\nHumans are free, creative, rational and worshiping beings who are far\ntoo complex to explain by the mere chance action of physical forces. Genesis\nreveals the divine origin of the inner self: \u201cAnd the Lord God\u2026breathed\ninto his nostrils the breath of life\u2026\u201d (Gen. 2:7). Unlike animals, humans\npossess rational faculties that are able to grow and progress both individually\nand historically. Additionally, the emotional characteristics of a person are\nhighly multifaceted. In fact, unlike the minds of animals, the human mind\nis uniquely capable of processing many emotions in a single moment. The\nmost complex animal behavior pales in comparison to the expressions of the\nsimplest human societies.\nScripture uses at least nine different terms to refer to the immaterial ele-\nment in humans:\nLife (Mark 8:35) Strength (Luke 10:27)\nSoul (Mark 8:36) Self (1 Cor. 4:3-4)\nSpirit (Ps. 31:5) Will (1 Cor. 7:37)\nMind (Rom. 7:25) Affections (Col. 3:2)\nHeart (Eph. 6:6)\n\nThis is not to say these terms are all synonyms. Each refers to the imma-\nterial self from a discernibly different point of view or describes a different\nfunction of the immaterial self. Even so, several of the terms could be inter-\nchangeable. For instance, the Greek word psuche translates to the English\nwords \u201clife\u201d (42 times), \u201csoul\u201d (53 times) and \u201cheart\u201d (2 times).\nThe words most frequently used to identify the immaterial self are\n\u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit.\u201d Soul translates the Hebrew word nephesh, and the Greek\nword psuche. Spirit is a translation of the Hebrew ruach, and the Greek\npneuma. All four of these words from the Hebrew and Greek also mean\n\u201cbreath\u201d or \u201cwind.\u201d These terms aptly express that the immaterial part of\nevery human derives from the \u201cbreath\u201d of God. When Jesus described to\nNicodemus the work of the Spirit of God, He said, \u201cThe wind [pneuma]\nblows [pnei] where it wishes\u2026\u201d (John 3:8). Some scholars think the clause\nshould be translated, \u201cThe Spirit breathes where He wills.\u201d The Greek\nwords are capable of either translation.7 The book of Job attributes the\ncreation of humans to the breath of God: \u201cBut there is a spirit in man, And\nthe breath of the Almighty gives him understanding\u201d (Job 32:8). A later\nportion of Job states, \u201cThe Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of\nthe Almighty gives me life\u201d (Job 33:4).\nOne erroneous belief is that unregenerated people have only a body and\nsoul until God imparts the spirit at the new birth. This view confuses the\nhuman spirit with the Holy Spirit who indwells believers. However, even\nungodly men are said to each have their own spirit (1 Chron. 5:26). The\nassertion that the \u201csoul\u201d is the human element, and the \u201cspirit\u201d is the divine\nelement again fails to differentiate the human spirit from the Holy Spirit. The\nsouls and spirits of humans are depicted in heaven (Heb. 12:23; Rev. 6:9),\nwhile \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d are both attributed to God the Father and Son (Isa.\n42:1; 53:11-12; Matt. 12:18; 26:38; Luke 23:46).\nConcerning the composition of each person, there are three classical\nschools of thought: (1) Trichotomy (three parts): body, soul and spirit, (2)\n7 See Rotherham\u2019s Emphasized Bible (Kregel); Worrel\u2019s New Testament (Gospel Publishing House); and the\nInterlinear Greek English Bible by Jay P. Green, Sr. (Associated Publishers and Authors, Wilmington, Delaware).\n\nDichotomy (two parts): body and soul (or spirit) and Monism (one part):\nbody, soul or spirit. Evangelical scholars have generally affirmed the view that\nhumans are either trichotomous or dichotomous. Monism does not appear\nsupportable from the biblical evidence.8\n1. Trichotomy\na) In Genesis 2:7, the combination of a body of dust and the breath\nof God resulted in a third part, the soul.\nb) First Thessalonians 5:23 definitely specifies three parts of a per-\nson: \u201cNow may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and\nmay your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the com-\ning of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nc) Hebrews 4:12 affirms that \u201c\u2026the word of God is living and pow-\nerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the divi-\nsion of soul and spirit, and of joint and marrow, and is a discerner of the\nthoughts and intents of the heart.\u201d\nd) When Paul spoke of men as carnal, natural (soulish) and spiri-\ntual, he seemed to indicate conditions related respectively to body, soul\nand spirit (1 Cor. 2:14-3:1).\n2. Dichotomy\na) Genesis 2:7 mentions only two distinct elements: the body of\nearth and the breath of God. The living \u201csoul\u201d is not a third part but the\nresult of body and spirit. It does not say man had a soul, but man became\na living soul [being].\n8 See W. Grudem, Systematic Theology. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1994) 483.\n\nb) Biblical writers seem to use the terms \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d inter-\nchangeably. For instance, in John 12:27 Jesus stated, \u201cNow is my soul\ntroubled\u2026\u201d However, later in John we read, \u201cWhen Jesus had said these\nthings, He was troubled in spirit\u2026\u201d (John 13:21; see also Gen. 41:8; Ps.\n42:6; Heb. 12:23; Rev. 6:9; 20:4).\nc) Scripture attributes \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d to animals as well as people\n(Eccles. 3:21; Rev. 16:3).\nd) Some scriptures attribute the term \u201csoul\u201d to Yahweh (Isa. 42:1;\n53:10-12; Jer. 9:9, KJV; Heb. 10:38).\ne) Scripture seems to attribute even the highest spiritual exercises to\nboth the soul and the spirit: \u201cAnd you shall love the LORD your God\u2026\nwith all your soul\u2026\u201d (Mark 12:30; see also Luke 1:46; Heb. 6:18-19;\nJas. 1:21).\nf) According to Jesus, to lose the soul is to lose everything: \u201cFor\nwhat will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own\nsoul?\u201d (Mark 8:36-37; Matt. 16:26; see also Matt. 10:28).\ng) In response to the seemingly trichotomous elements of the bene-\ndiction in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, dichotomists will likely argue that Paul\ndid not view body, soul and spirit as three distinct and separable parts.\nRather, he used soul and spirit in the same manner Jesus used \u201cheart,\u201d\n\u201csoul,\u201d \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d in Mark 12:30. When referring to the\nrational part of personhood, Paul used \u201cmind\u201d (translated from nine dif-\nferent Greek words) more frequently than he used \u201csoul.\u201d\nh) Some reference \u201cthe division of soul and spirit\u201d in Hebrews 4:12\nas an argument for trichotomy. Dichotomists respond that the \u201cword\u201d\ndoes not divide the \u201csoul\u201d from the \u201cspirit\u201d but rather penetrates into the\ndeepest recesses of a person\u2019s being, even to \u201cthe thoughts and intents of\nthe heart.\u201d W. E. Vine commented:\n\nThe Word of God pierces through all that lies deepest in\nhuman nature, not actually separating soul from spirit\nand joints from marrow, but piercing and laying bare the\ninmost being, cutting through the most secret recesses\nof the spirit\u2019s life, penetrating the soul and, deeper still,\nthe spirit, as through joints to their very marrow.9\ni) Dichotomists believe there is a difference between \u201csoul\u201d and\n\u201cspirit.\u201d Although frequently used to designate the same immaterial part\nof a person, these words also refer to a person\u2019s inner self in different rela-\ntionships. When distinguishing the meaning of the words, the soul faces\nearthward, the spirit faces heavenward. In other words, the soul involves\nearthly relationships while the spirit involves spiritual and immortal rela-\ntionships. Even so, dichotomists believe both \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d consti-\ntute the immaterial self.\n3. Monism\nMonism is a general philosophical term that attempts to explain phenom-\nena by a single or unifying principle.10 When applied to a theological discussion\nof personhood, monism views the immaterial and material (corporeal) self as\ninseparable. Outside the realm of biblical Christianity, philosophers have argued\nfor centuries against a duality or plurality of elements in the human person.\nThe notion that immaterial personality and the material body are inex-\norably and permanently attached naturally leads to the belief that either (1)\ndeath ends existence or (2) only a connected and simultaneous resurrection\nof the body and spirit (or soul) allows for continued existence. Both of these\npossibilities find no support in the Scripture. The Bible consistently rep-\nresents humans with both material and immaterial elements separable either\nby death of the body or miraculous intervention (Gen. 5:24; Heb. 11:5).\n9 William Edwy Vine, The Epistle to the Hebrews (London: Oliphants Ltd., 1961) 64.\n10 See S. Blackburn, Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1994).\n\nIt is important to note that while monism is scripturally unsupportable,\nthe difference between the trichotomous and dichotomous views of person-\nhood does not significantly affect major doctrine.\nC. Became a living soul (being) Genesis 2:7\n1. Personhood as a unity: The Bible speaks of the unity of personhood.\nThe soul (spirit) separates from the body at physical death, but only for an\ninterim period, awaiting the resurrection. Paul spoke of the soul as naked\nwithout the body:\n\u201cNow we know that if the earthly tent we live in is\ndestroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal\nhouse in heaven, not built by human hands. Meanwhile\nwe groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly\ndwelling, because when we are clothed, we will not be\nfound naked. For while we are in this tent, we groan and\nare burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed\nbut to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that\nwhat is mortal may be swallowed up by life\u201d (2 Cor.\n5:1-4, NIV).\nThe ancient Greeks considered the soul in the afterlife to be a disembod-\nied spirit. In contrast, Christian believers anticipate a union of the spirit with\nthe glorified body, a body like that of Jesus, risen from the grave and trans-\nformed. The apostle Paul spoke of this redeemed body when he wrote, \u201cNot\nonly that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves\ngroan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of\nthe body\u201d (Rom. 8:23).\nChrist\u2019s vicarious atoning work redeems the whole person, not just the\nsoul or spirit. This holistic redemption gives powerful meaning to Paul\u2019s ben-\nediction: \u201cNow may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and\nmay your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming\nof our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (1 Thess. 5:23).\n\nIt appears Jesus had human wholeness in mind when He said, \u201cAnd you\nshall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all\nyou mind, and with all your strength\u201d (Mark 12:30). Speaking of personhood\nas a unity, Swiss physician and psychiatrist Paul Tournier wrote:\nScience, in fact, works only by analysis, by dividing ad\ninfinitum the object of study\u2026What happens then is\nlike what happens when we separate a jigsaw puzzle\ninto its five hundred pieces: the overall picture disap-\npears. This is the state of modern medicine; it has lost\nthe sense of the unity of man. Such is the price it has\npaid for its scientific progress. It has sacrificed art to\nscience. Its discoveries are true; that is to say, they reveal\nvalid and important facts. But they do not lead to a true\nunderstanding of man, because he is a synthesis. We\nshall not come to understand man by adding up all the\nitems of analytical knowledge that we possess of him,\nbut by comprehending him as a unified whole. Man is\nnot just a body and a mind. He is a spiritual being. It\nis impossible to know him if one disregards his deepest\nreality.\u201d11\n2. The origin of the soul or spirit: There are three leading theories con-\ncerning the source of each newly born person\u2019s soul: preexistence, creation-\nism, and traducianism.\na) Preexistence is the belief that the human soul exists before con-\nception and is placed by God into each person sometime before birth.\nAlong with believing in the preexistence of the soul, some believe in\nthe transmigration of the soul, which means the soul transfers from\none body to another human, animal or spiritual body. Hinduism,\nTheosophy, Rosicrucianism, as well as many indigenous and occult\nreligions, hold the theory of the transmigration of the soul. Regardless,\n11 Paul Tournier, The Healing of Persons, trans. by Edwin Hudson (New York: Harper and Row, 1965) 54-55.\n\nthis theory does not have scriptural support and is contradicted by\nverses such as Hebrews 9:27.\nb) Creationism (not to be confused with the question of the cre-\nation of the world) is asserted by many Roman Catholic and Reformed\ntheologians. According to the creationist view of the origin of the soul,\nGod generates the soul directly in each newly conceived person sometime\nbetween conception and birth, while the parents propagate only the body\n(see Isa. 42:5; 57:16; Eccles. 12:7; Zech. 12:1; Heb. 12:9).\nOne problem with the creationism position is it appears to make\nGod the creator of sinful souls, or at least represents God as situating a\npure soul in a depraved Adamic body. Further, it appears that the same\nscripture given to support direct creation can also be interpreted to vali-\ndate the indirect agency of God in procreation.\nc) Traducianism is a preferred theory among many non-Reformed\nconservative scholars. According to traducianism, God created the human\nrace in Adam, and from Adam both body and soul were procreated by\nnatural generation (see Job 14:4; 15:14; Ps. 51:5; 58:3; John 3:6; Eph.\n2:3). Strong stated, \u201cTraducianism holds that man, as a species, was cre-\nated in Adam. In Adam, the substance of humanity was yet undisturbed.\nWe derive our immaterial as well as our material being, by natural laws of\npropagation, from Adam; each individual human after Adam possessing\na part of the substance that was originated in him.\u201d12\nThe arguments for the traducian theory include the following:\n(1) The Bible does not record that God directly created any person\nbut Adam and Eve. After creating Adam and Eve, God rested from His\nwork (Gen. 2.2).\n12 Augustus Hopkins Strong, Systematic Theology (Philadelphia: Griffith and Rowland Press, 1907-09) 494.\n\n(2) It best explains the inherited sinful nature of the human as\nexpressed by David: \u201cBehold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin\nmy mother conceived me\u201d (Ps. 51:5).\n(3) It is supported by a vital statistic about the family of Jacob: \u201cAll\nthe persons [souls] who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came from his\nbody, besides Jacob\u2019s sons\u2019 wives, were sixty-six persons [souls] in all\u201d\n(Gen. 46:26).\n(4) It is consistent with the Bible record of procreation: \u201cAnd Adam\nlived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness,\nafter his image, and named him Seth\u201d (Gen. 5:3).\n(5) It helps explain personality likenesses between children and parents.\n(6) The soul does not have purely natural origins. God has indirectly\ncreated all souls since Adam and is, therefore, the sustainer of the process\nof procreation (Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3).\nV. The Original State of Humans\nTo understand the human condition, it is important to examine the\noriginal state of humans before the Fall. Consequently, this section will look\nat the psychological, moral, social, occupational and spiritual condition of\nAdam and Eve as occupants of their God-given Edenic home.\nA. The state of knowledge\nGod gave Adam the task of naming all the animals, birds and, perhaps,\nall other forms of life, as God had given Adam dominion over every liv-\ning thing (Gen. 1:28; 2:19-20). This assignment required a vast knowledge.\nApparently, Adam\u2019s knowledge included insight into the nature and relative\npurpose of each species. In primitive times names did more than identify the\n\nholder; they revealed character and destiny. The father of the human race was\nnot a full-grown adolescent; he was the resident \u201cscientist\u201d of Eden.\nB. The moral state\nSince holiness and righteousness are among the fundamental attributes\nof God, Adam and Eve, created in God\u2019s image, must have shared God\u2019s holy\nand righteous character. When God had completed the creation, it was per-\nfect: \u201cThen God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very\ngood\u201d (Gen. 1:31a). A comparison of Ephesians 4:24 with Colossians 3:9-10\nstrongly implies the original righteousness of Adam and Eve. Although their\nwill was soon tested, God created Adam and Eve in a state of holiness, devoid\nof evil.\nC. The psychological state\nGod created Adam and Eve with several basic instincts (needs, drives or\nimpulses). The following seem to be some of Adam\u2019s instincts or needs:\n1. Self-preservation: God warned Adam of impending death if he ate of\nthe forbidden tree (Gen. 2:16-17).\n2. The desire for food: God provided every kind of plant and tree good\nfor food (Gen. 1:29).\n3. The urge for procreation or sex: Adam and Eve were commanded to\nmultiply and replenish the earth (Gen. 1:28). Genesis says about man and\nwoman: \u201cTherefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to\nhis wife\u2026\u201d (Gen. 2:24).\n4. The need for acquisition: God placed Adam and Eve in their own\ngarden, which they lost with the Fall (Gen. 2:15).\n\n5. The drive for domination: Adam was commanded to have dominion\nover the earth and over every created thing (Gen. 1:28). These instincts were\nfor Adam and Eve\u2019s good; they continue to exist for the good of humans.\nHowever, they must not be abused. These natural urges are desires of the\n\u201cflesh,\u201d and they must be yielded to the leading of the Holy Spirit.\nD. The social state\nHumans are social creatures made for companionship and community:\n\u201cAnd the LORD God said, \u2018It is not good that man should be alone; I will\nmake him a helper comparable to him\u2019\u201d (Gen. 2:18; see also Gen. 2:23-24).\nWith the creation of Eve, Adam had constant companionship with a being of\nhis own kind. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had daily communion\nwith God and with each other. When Adam and Eve sinned, they became\nalienated from God and suspicious of each other. Before their rebellion,\nAdam saw Eve as \u201cbone of my bones And flesh of my flesh\u2026\u201d (Gen. 2:23).\nAfter their rebellion, Adam spoke of Eve as \u201cThe woman whom You gave to\nbe with me\u2026\u201d (Gen. 3:12).\nE. The occupational state\nThe Garden of Eden was an active and dynamic place: \u201cThen the LORD\nGod took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to tend and keep\nit\u201d (Gen. 2:15). Adam was both a zoologist and a horticulturist. The beauty\nand productivity of Eden were entrusted to Adam as he kept and tended the\ngarden. The word \u201ckeep\u201d seems to suggest the necessity to \u201cprotect\u201d the gar-\nden, while the word \u201ctend\u201d suggests giving it touches of human handiwork.\nCreative occupation is essential for human fulfillment. Work became \u201ctoil\u201d\nonly after sin entered the scene (Gen. 3:17-19).\nF. The state of life expectancy\nAdam and Eve were created with the potential for immortality. Adam was\ntold by God that death would occur only if he disobeyed God by eating from\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:16-17). When Adam and\nEve sinned, death began its reign. Subsequently, angels with flaming swords\n\nguarded the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). However, Jesus Christ (the last Adam)\nremoved the sting of death. The Seed of woman has now bruised the serpent\u2019s\nhead, and through God\u2019s Son, paradise has been restored (Gen. 3:15).\nAdam and Eve were created in God\u2019s image, in holiness and righteous-\nness. They were placed in an ideal environment with a fulfilling occupation\nand purpose. God gave them the gift of His presence as well as the gift of\nmarital love and companionship. Even with the potential for immortality,\nAdam and Eve disobeyed and fell. How could they have forfeited so much,\nnot only for themselves, but for the entire human race? The answer to this\nquestion is rooted in the Fall.\nVI. The Fall\nAt the heart of the Christian gospel is the famed statement, \u201cFor God so\nloved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes\nin Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16). God sent\nHis Son to rescue us from our perishing condition. If God loved humans so\nmuch, how did humans fall into a state of perishing? The Declaration of Faith\nof The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (ICFG) provides this\nbrief explanation:\nWe believe that man was created in the image of God,\nbefore Whom he walked in holiness and purity, but that\nby voluntary disobedience and transgression, he fell from\nthe Eden of purity and innocence to the depths of sin and\niniquity, and that in consequence of this, all mankind are\nsinners sold unto Satan, sinners not by constraint but\nby choice, shapen in iniquity and utterly void by nature\nof that holiness required by the law of God, positively\ninclined to evil, guilty and without excuse, justly deserv-\ning the condemnation of a just and holy God.13\n13 Aimee Semple McPherson, Declaration of Faith (Los Angeles: International Church of the Foursquare\nGospel, n.d.) 10.\n\nAlthough they were created in God\u2019s image, placed in an ideal environ-\nment and given everything they needed, Adam and Eve rebelled against God\nand disobeyed His commandment. The result of their sin was shame, guilt,\nalienation and death, not only for themselves but also for the entire human\nrace. In light of the devastating consequences of sin, why would God subject\nAdam and Eve to temptation? (see Ps. 14:1-3; Rom. 3:10-23; 5:12-21).\nA. The probation of humankind\n1. Its purpose: Created in God\u2019s image and endowed with intelligence,\nemotion and will, men and women are free, moral agents capable of making\nchoices. Since humans are created for God\u2019s glory (Isa. 43:7) and can best\nglorify God by freely choosing to worship and serve Him, it was necessary\nhumans be given an opportunity to choose. For Adam and Eve, the Garden\nof Eden was not only a home in paradise, it was also a place of probation, a\nplace to test their obedience and loyalty to Yahweh. The probation of Adam\nand Eve was based on a clear, direct commandment, a simple law of works.\nThe law had two parts: a positive part, consisting of a glorious provision; and\na negative part, consisting of a clear prohibition: \u201cAnd the LORD God com-\nmanded the man, saying, \u2018Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but\nof the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day\nthat you eat of it you shall surely die\u2019\u201d (Gen. 2:16-17).\nIt is important to explain how beings created with holy natures could\nsin. Adam and Eve were each created with a holy nature, but they were not\nborn with holy character. A holy nature is the result of creation, while holy\ncharacter is the result of choosing good when the choice for evil is possible.\nEvil choices produce evil character. God desired humans to worship and serve\nHim with holy, moral character. Consequently, free choice was necessary for\nthe development of mature holiness and blessedness. With free choice there is,\nof necessity, the possibility of wrong choice. Adam and Eve made the wrong\nchoice with disastrous consequences for themselves and the human race.\n2. Its character: The probationary commandment given to Adam and\nEve was personal, not moral. There was no obvious wrong in eating from\nthe forbidden tree; the fall of Adam and Eve was the result of disobedience,\n\nnot the result of a clearly immoral act. This test was similar to the later test\nof Abraham and the offering of his only son, Isaac. The test of Abraham was\npurely personal, not moral. There would have been no intrinsic wrongdoing\nby Abraham in sparing his son. He moved toward the sacrifice of Isaac as an\nact of pure obedience to God (Gen. 22:1-13).\nPeople obey a moral law because it is inherently right to do so. For exam-\nple, the Ten Commandments are right not simply because they came from\nGod but because they also represent inherently right conduct. Conversely,\nsome ceremonial law simply required obedience because that law came from\nGod; its rightness was not self-evident. The prohibition of eating from the\ntree of good and evil was a testing law because the evil was not self-evident;\nthe evil was in the disobedience of the commandment. The fall of Adam and\nEve resulted from a pure act of willful disobedience.\n3. Its reasonableness: The reasonableness of the probation of Adam and\nEve is apparent in several ways. First, an all-wise God knew what was nec-\nessary to bring people to their highest potential development and greatest\nblessedness. If Adam and Eve had obeyed, resisting Satan\u2019s temptation, they\nwould have possessed holy, moral character and would have risen to a new\nlevel of blessing and fellowship with God. There is a hint of this in the char-\nacter and in the consequent translation of Enoch to heaven. Enoch devel-\noped holy character even after inheriting an Adamic nature. If Adam had\nobeyed, he would have had heaven on earth. A loving God would not have\nsubjected Adam to probation had it not been necessary for Adam\u2019s highest\npossible good.\nSecond, God, having foreseen Adam\u2019s failure, provided a plan for his\nredemption. God is not the author of sin. He did not cause Adam to fall,\nfor Adam had every reason to obey. However, God purposed to bring out\nof human failure a glorious redemption; a redemption wrought through the\nincarnation and vicarious death of His own Son; a redemption that would\ninclude the final defeat of Satan who was, after all, the first sinner.\n\nWithin the very curse pronounced upon the serpent, God gave a promise\nof a Redeemer, \u201cher Seed,\u201d and of Satan\u2019s defeat, \u201cHe shall bruise your head\u201d\n(Gen. 3:15). The animals slain to cover Adam and Eve\u2019s nakedness and Abel\u2019s\noffering of an acceptable lamb to God are both representative of the redemp-\ntion that would be provided through the blood of Jesus (Gen. 3:21; 4:4).\nThe apostle Peter declared that Christ, as a lamb, was purposed \u201cbefore the\nfoundation of the world\u201d (1 Pet. 1:18-20). Therefore, God in His foreknowl-\nedge saw that Adam and Eve would fail and determined to bring out of their\nfailure a people gloriously redeemed by the blood of Christ. It appears that\nAdam and Eve\u2019s testing was necessary and reasonable because all potential\nresults of Adam and Eve\u2019s response would have ultimately led to a final state\nsuperior to their original Edenic state.\nB. The temptation\n1. The agent of temptation: Genesis attributes the temptation of Adam\nand Eve to a serpent, \u201cmore crafty than any beast of the field\u201d (Gen. 3:1,\nNASB). The real tempter, however, was Satan. Revelation alludes to the ser-\npent as Satan: \u201cSo the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the\nDevil and Satan, who deceives the whole world\u2026\u201d (Rev. 12:9). The apostle\nPaul strengthened the connection of Satan as the serpent, suggesting the same\ntempter who deceived Eve is still present and seeking to corrupt the minds of\nbelievers. \u201cBut I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft-\niness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ\u201d\n(2 Cor. 11:3).\nFurthermore, Genesis 3:1 does not state that the serpent was more crafty\nthan any \u201cother\u201d beast, but more crafty than \u201cany\u201d beast of the field. The\nserpent was the vehicle Satan used to effect the temptation. Apparently, Satan\nhas the power to disguise himself by assuming the appearance of another\nbeing or form. Even Paul writes, \u201cFor Satan himself transforms himself into\nan angel of light\u201d (2 Cor. 11:14).\nSome scholars believe the serpent was originally an upright animal and\nthe most beautiful of all the creatures. This seems likely because the curse\nupon the serpent reduced him to a crawling creature. That the real tempter\n\nwas Satan (who had previously rebelled against God) is clear by the prophecy\nthat the \u201cSeed of woman\u201d (Christ) would bruise the serpent\u2019s head. Isaiah\n14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:12-15 describe Satan\u2019s rebellious posture and fall.\nSatan seldom reveals himself as God\u2019s direct adversary. Instead, he frequently\ndisguises himself in the form of a benefactor or fulfiller of selfish ambitions.\n2. The motives of temptation: What kind of motivation did Satan use to\ntempt holy, innocent beings into disobeying their God? As previously men-\ntioned, God endowed Adam and Eve with certain basic instincts needed for\ntheir own well-being. These instincts or drives included self-preservation,\nacquisition, desire for food, desire for love and procreation, and the urge\nfor dominion. These drives constituted a motivational base to which Satan\ncould direct temptation. Satan aimed his temptation at three of Eve\u2019s basic\ndesires: \u201cSo when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was\npleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its\nfruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate\u201d (Gen. 3:6).\nUnquestionably, these were not inherently evil desires. They became evil\nbecause they were used for Satan\u2019s purposes in direct disobedience to God\u2019s\nspecific commandment. Desire becomes lust when it is contrary to the will\nof the Spirit. Many scholars believe John was referring to the pattern of Eve\u2019s\ntemptation when he wrote: \u201cFor all that is in the world\u2014the lust of the flesh,\nthe lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u2014is not of the Father but is of the\nworld. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the\nwill of God abides forever\u201d (1 John 2:16-17). The term \u201cworld\u201d in this verse\ndoes not refer to the earth but to the societal realm ruled by Satan; the term\n\u201cflesh\u201d has reference not to the body as such but to the total person dedicated\nto selfishness and disobedience to God.\nIt is important to notice that Satan did not appeal to Eve\u2019s desires until\nhe first tempted her to doubt the Lord. He began his temptation with the\ninsinuating question, \u201cHas God indeed said, \u2018You shall not eat of every tree\nof the garden\u2019?\u201d (Gen. 3:1). This question is contrived to tempt Eve to doubt\nGod\u2019s goodness. Next Satan states, \u201cYou will not surely die\u201d to raise doubts\nabout God\u2019s veracity (Gen. 3:4).\n\nWith the seeds of doubt planted, Satan unveiled himself as God\u2019s enemy\nby asserting that God was trying to deprive Adam and Eve of their supposed\nright to achieve divine status: \u201cFor God knows that in the day you eat of it\nyour eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil\u201d\n(Gen. 3:5). Once this seed of doubt was planted and had germinated, Satan\nappealed to Eve\u2019s desires. Perhaps Eve thought if God\u2019s truth and goodness\nwere suspect, she must then pursue her own interests. Scholars disagree on\nwhether Eve\u2019s rebellion may have been one or all of the deadly sins of self,\ndoubt or pride (see 1 Tim. 3:6; 2 Pet. 2:10; Jas. 1:5-8, NIV). It seems all three\nsins contributed to the ultimate fall of the first humans, Adam and Eve.\nC. The fallen state\nThe Scripture clearly teaches that humans were created in the image of\nGod. Genesis 3 describes Adam and Eve\u2019s disobedience and fall. Genesis 4 -\nGenesis 11 portrays the calamities and strife of Adam and Eve\u2019s descendants.\nAlthough humans still bear enough of God\u2019s image to demonstrate divine\norigin, the history of war, crime, terrorism and perversion provide incontro-\nvertible evidence of the Fall. The noblest ideals of humanity provide evidence\nthat humans are created by God. However, the greed and brutality of human-\nity offers proof of the corruption of humans by sin. Without an inspired\nrecord of the Fall, we would still have to assume an evil occurrence at the\ndawn of history to account for such tragic human drama, drama that could\nonly be redeemed by the divine intervention of Christ\u2019s incarnation, resurrec-\ntion and promised return (see Job. 31:33; Rom. 5:12-14; 1 Cor. 15:22-45; 1\nTim. 2:13-14).\n1. The interpretation of the Fall: Is the account of the fall of Adam and\nEve figurative or literal? Is it myth and allegory with symbolic meaning, or is it\nliteral, factual history? While some theologians interpret Genesis 1 - Genesis\n11 as myth, the following facts argue for a literal interpretation:\na) Nowhere in the Bible is the story of Adam interpreted symboli-\ncally. If the Creation and Fall stories were merely allegorical, the spiritu-\nalized interpretations would have been numerous.\n\nb) There is no indication in Genesis 11 and Genesis 12 suggesting\na change from allegory to history. Noah is as much a real character as\nis Abraham.\nc) The apostle Paul paralleled Adam and Christ in his writings. Since\nChrist is a historical person, it is unlikely He would be an antitype of a\nnon-historical character (see Rom. 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:22-45).\nd) Adam\u2019s name appears with other historical characters such as\nDavid, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in two different genealogy scriptures\n(see 1 Chron. 1-2; Luke 3:23-38).\ne) Real geographical locations are included in the story of Adam such\nas Assyria and the river Euphrates.\nf) The fallen condition of people is literal and true. The truly fallen\nstate of humans can hardly be attributed to a mythical event. Moreover,\nthe fact that humankind has made extraordinary scientific and technolog-\nical progress, while making little or no moral, ethical or social progress,\ndemonstrates the sinful human nature. The persistence of war, crime, ter-\nrorism, greed, political corruption and perversion exhibits the existence\nof human sinfulness as well as the existence of a supernatural evil force\nmotivating human wickedness.\n2. The results of the Fall: In response to the Fall, God rendered judicial\nverdicts on the serpent, the woman, the man and the ground.\na) The judgment upon the serpent was the apparently upright and\nbeautiful creature was doomed to a crawling posture (Gen. 3:14-15).\nThe eating of \u201cdust\u201d denoted utter humiliation. According to Isaiah, the\nserpent will eat dust during the Millennium, but he will be harmless (Isa.\n65:25).\nb) The judgment upon the woman was the increase of pain and sor-\nrow in childbearing, and submission to her husband (Gen. 3:16).\n\nc) The judgment upon the man was not that of labor, but of weari-\nsome toil (Gen. 3:17). Work is a boon to humankind, but seldom is it\nfree from strife and criticism. This curse is evident the world over in the\nfear of crop failure, the fear of unemployment, labor strife, bankruptcies\nand relentless competition.\nd) The judgment upon the ground was lowered productivity and\nthe introduction of thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18). Jesus used the\nillustration of thorns and thistles as the opposite of good fruit (Matt.\n7:16-17). Thorns became a symbol of evil and were associated with Satan\n(2 Cor. 12:7). The fact that malevolent men, motivated by Satan, placed\na crown of thorns upon the brow of Jesus evidences the evil symbol-\nism of the thorn (John 19:2). The prophet Isaiah predicted the lifting\nof the curse and the removal of the thorn during the Millennium (Isa.\n55:12-13).\n3. The consequences of the Fall\na) Adam and Eve immediately experienced shame as a consequences of\ntheir sin. They hid themselves from God because they were suddenly aware\nof their nakedness. Shame led to fear and alienation. They wanted the expe-\nriential knowledge of good and evil, which they were tempted to believe\nwould make them divine. Instead of experiencing a greater awareness of the\ndivine, they experienced a new awareness of shame (Gen. 3:7-13).\nb) One of the most disastrous consequence of the Fall was death.\nGod had warned Adam and Eve that they would certainly die if they ate\nfrom the forbidden tree (Gen. 2:17b). There were two trees in the gar-\nden: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. Adam\nand Eve willfully ate from the tree of \u201cknowledge,\u201d which led them to the\nknowledge of good and evil and to the experience of death. As they had\nbeen warned, God expelled them from the garden, from the tree of life\nand from His own presence. While Adam and Eve did not immediately\ndie physically (he lived 930 years), the process of disease and mortality\ncommenced the moment they sinned: \u201cAnd as it is appointed for men to\n\ndie once, but after this the judgment\u201d (Heb. 9:27). Perhaps the psalmist\nbest described mortality:\nYou have set our iniquities before You, Our secret sins\nin the light of Your countenance. For all our days have\npassed away in Your wrath; We finish our years like a\nsigh. The days of our lives are seventy years; And if by\nreason of strength they are eighty years, Yet their boast is\nonly labor and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly\naway\u2026So teach us to number our days, That we may\ngain a heart of wisdom (Ps. 90:8-12).\nThe Bible identifies and describes three categories of death:\n(1) Physical death: Physical death occurs when the spirit is separated\nfrom the body and the body returns to dust (Gen. 3:19). In the old dis-\npensation, only Enoch and Elijah escaped physical death (Gen. 5:24; 2\nKings 2:11). In the new dispensation, only those who are taken up in the\nRapture escape physical death (1 Thess. 4:16-17). Jesus raised several per-\nsons from the dead, and several others were raised from the dead under\nthe ministry of the first apostles. However, those individuals eventually\ndied natural deaths (John 11:43-44; Acts 9:40).\n(2) Spiritual death: Spiritual death is separation from God. All unre-\ngenerate people are alienated from God by sin (Eph. 2:13). However,\nthey may pass from death to spiritual life by exercising saving faith in the\nLord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 15:54-57; Eph. 2:4-6; Col. 1:13-14, 18-23; 1\nJohn. 5:11-12). \u201cFor since by man came death, by Man also came the\nresurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall\nbe made alive\u201d (1 Cor. 15:21-22; see also Rom. 5:12-14).\n(3) Eternal death: Eternal death is the condition of those who are\nspiritually dead, who depart this earthly life without repentance of sin\nand without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Eternal death is the punish-\nment of those who are terminally unbelieving, unrepentant and disobe-\ndient (2 Thess. 1:7-10). The judgment unto eternal death (also called the\n\nsecond death) will take place at the end of the Millennium, before the\nGreat White Throne of God. It will be a judgment for sinners only; the\nbeliever\u2019s judgment of works will take place at the Rapture (2 Cor. 5:6-\n11; Rev. 20:11-15).\nVII. The State of Grace\nBecause the doctrine of humankind is more than just the study of the\nFall, sinful nature and the consequent judgments, this final section will deal\nwith believers in the state of grace.\nA. Believers are made new in Christ Jesus\nBut you have not so learned of Christ, if indeed you have\nheard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth\nis in Jesus: that you put off, concerning your former\nconduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to\nthe deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your\nmind, and that you put on the new man which was cre-\nated according to God, in true righteousness and holiness\n(Eph.4:20-24; see also John 1:11-13; 2 Cor. 5:17).\nB. Believers have new potential through Christ\nAs the result of Christ\u2019s incarnation and identification with human\nnature, human beings have received new potential in Christ:\nAnd so it is written, \u201cThe first man Adam became a liv-\ning being.\u201d The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.\nHowever, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and\nafterward the spiritual. The first man was of the earth,\nmade of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven.\nAs was the man of dust, so also are those who are made\nof dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who\n\nare heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the man\nof dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man\n(1 Cor. 15:45-49; see also 1 Cor. 15:21-22; Col. 3:9-10).\nAdam corrupted human nature by sin, disobedience and rebellion.\nChrist, by taking human nature into union with His divine nature, and\nby living sinlessly in perfect obedience to His Father, redeemed and gave\nhuman nature a new potential. In Adam, we have paradise lost; in Christ\nJesus, we have paradise regained. In Adam, our fate is death; in Christ Jesus,\nour potential is for life and eternal fellowship with God. As Paul stated in\nhis greetings to the Philippian church, \u201cin Christ\u201d is the position of every\nbeliever (Phil. 1:1). All Christians are members of the Body of Christ and\nof the new humanity.\nC. Believers have new natures in Christ\nPeter wrote to the church that Christ has given us \u201c\u2026exceedingly great\nand precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine\nnature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\u201d (2\nPet. 1:4). The word \u201cpromises\u201d in this passage refers not to the promise itself,\nbut to the thing or things promised by God (the fulfillment of the promises).\nThe Word is filled with promises of great blessing to the believer who has\nbeen redeemed from corruption and given a new nature by the fulfillment of\nGod\u2019s promises in Christ.\nD. Believers have new life in Christ\n\u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him\nwho sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has\npassed from death into life\u201d (John 5:24; see also Rom. 6:11; Eph. 2:16).\nE. Believers can experience constant renewal in Christ\n\u201cTherefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perish-\ning, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day\u201d (2 Cor. 4:16). \u201cAnd do\n\nnot be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your\nmind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will\nof God\u201d (Rom. 12:2; see also Rom. 12:1).\nF. In Christ, believers have the hope of an eternal heavenly home\n\u201cAnd the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for\nHis heavenly kingdom\u201d (2 Tim. 4:18). \u201c\u2026to an inheritance incorruptible\nand undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you\u2026\u201d (1\nPet. 1:4; see also John. 14:2-3).\nG. In Christ, believers have victory over the old nature\n\u201cNow if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him\u2026\nTherefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it\nin its lusts\u2026For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under\nlaw, but under grace\u201d (Rom. 6:8, 12, 14).\nH. Believers in Christ are given kingdom authority\nFreed from the dominion of sin and death, believers in Christ also receive\nkingdom authority to minister in the name of Jesus and in the power of the\nSpirit. \u201cSo then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was received up\ninto heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went out and\npreached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word\nthrough the accompanying signs\u201d (Mark 16:19-20; see also Matt. 16:19;\n18:18; Luke 9:1-2).\nIndividuals redeemed and surrendered to Christ become vehicles of wit-\nness by which God extends his message of salvation to all humanity. The\natoning work of Christ has made a state of grace the potential for all humans:\n\u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that who-\never believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16).\nUltimately, the story of humanity\u2019s fall and redemption is the story of God\u2019s\npowerful, pursuing love.\n\n"};
