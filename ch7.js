The\nDeclaration of Faith of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel\nstates the following:\nWe believe that Divine Healing is the power of the Lord\nJesus Christ to heal the sick and the afflicted in answer to\nbelieving prayer; that He who is the same yesterday, and\ntoday and forever has never changed but is still an all-suf-\nficient help in the time of trouble, able to meet the needs\nof, and quicken into newness of life, the body, as well as\nthe soul and spirit, in answer to the faith of them who ever\npray with submission to His divine and sovereign will.1\nEvery minister should study, teach and practice the ministry of divine\nhealing. A thorough study of Scripture will lead to a greater appreciation\nof and availability to the ministry of divine healing. The following chapter\nwill examine the reasonableness of divine healing, the origin of sickness, the\nspiritual nature of sickness, healing and the will of God, scriptural support\n1 Aimee Semple McPherson, Declaration of Faith (Los Angeles, CA: international Church of the Foursquare\nGospel, n.d.) 20.\n\nof divine healing, divine healing through the church age, divine healing and\nthe atonement, why Jesus healed the sick, why Christians should seek divine\nhealing, methods of administering divine healing, why some are not healed,\nhow to respond to divine healing, divine life for the body and answers to\nobjections to divine healing.\nI. The Reasonableness of Divine Healing\nA careful examination of Scripture should lead to a reasonable expecta-\ntion that God heals the physical afflictions of those who seek His aid. Based\non what the Bible reveals about God\u2019s will, purpose and power, it is entirely\nreasonable to believe that God is interested in the physical health of all\nhumans. In fact, from the beginning of creation, God has demonstrated His\nconcern and care for the physical needs of humans. God\u2019s promises to care\nfor the physical needs of humanity have always surpassed humanity\u2019s faith to\nreceive what God has promised.\nA. God cares about the human body\nIn 1 Corinthians Paul wrote about God\u2019s concern for the human body:\nFoods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God\nwill destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for\nsexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the\nbody. And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise\nus up by His power. Do you not know that your bodies\nare members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of\nChrist and make them members of a harlot? Certainly not!\nOr do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one\nbody with her? For \u201cthe two,\u201d He says, \u201cshall become one\nflesh.\u201d But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with\nHim. Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is\noutside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality\nsins against his own body. Or do you not know that your\n\nbody is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom\nyou have from God, and you are not your own? For you\nwere bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body\nand in your spirit, which are God\u2019s (1 Cor. 6:13-20).\nAlong with the soul and spirit, the human body is intended to be for God:\n\u201cNow the body is\u2026for the Lord, and the Lord [is] for the body.\u201d God has\nnot only provided for the needs of the spiritual nature of humans, He has also\nprovided for the physical needs of humans: \u201cThe Lord [is] for the body.\u201d The\nfollowing are some of the ways God expresses concern for the human body:\n1. Humans were created in the image of God: \u201cThen God said, \u2018Let Us\nmake man in Our image, according to Our likeness\u2026So God created man\nin His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He\ncreated them\u201d (Gen. 1:26-27). While this applies particularly to the spiritual\nnature of humans, the \u201cimage of God\u201d must have some relation to the human\nbody as well. This is also suggested in Genesis 9:6 which states, \u201cWhoever\nsheds man\u2019s blood, By man his blood shall be shed; For in the image of God\nHe made man.\u201d The punishment for murdering another human being is based\non humans being made \u201cin the image of God.\u201d This seems to point to the\nimage of God having some relationship to the physical body of humans. The\nincarnation of Jesus also demonstrates that the human body is able to express\nthe divine will and purposes of God and is therefore important to God.\n2. The human body is included in Christ\u2019s redemption: \u201c\u2026even we our-\nselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemp-\ntion of our body\u201d (Rom. 8:23). The body of a Christian belongs to God\nbecause it has been purchased by God: \u201cOr do you not know that your body\nis the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and\nyou are not your own? For you were bought at a price\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19-20).\nThe soul, spirit and body are all included in Christ\u2019s redemptive work.\n3. The body of a Christian is a member of Christ: \u201cDo you not know that\nyour bodies are members of Christ?\u201d (1 Cor. 6:15). Again, it is the physical\nbody that is emphasized in this scripture, not the soul or spirit.\n\n4. God is deeply concerned about the sanctity of the physical body: In\nthe 1 Corinthians 6:15-18 passage, Paul emphasized sins that specifically\ndefile the physical body.\n5. The body of a Christian is the temple of the Holy Spirit: \u201cOr do you\nnot know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19). If\nGod was deeply concerned with every detail of the Tabernacle in the wilder-\nness and the Temple in Jerusalem, how much more is He concerned with the\nhuman body, which is the dwelling place of His Holy Spirit.\n6. Christians are urged to glorify God in their physical bodies: \u201cFor you\nwere bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit,\nwhich are God\u2019s\u201d (1 Cor. 6:20). Just as individuals can glorify God with the\nattitude of their spirit, they can also glorify God with the actions of their\nphysical body.\n7. Christians are urged to present their bodies to God as a living sacrifice:\n\u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present\nyour bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reason-\nable service\u201d (Rom. 12:1). Again, note that the emphasis of this passage is on\nthe body, not the soul or spirit. After Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego\ncame out of the fiery furnace unharmed, Nebuchadnezzar said, \u201cBlessed be\nthe God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and\ndelivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king\u2019s\nword, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any\ngod except their own God!\u201d (Dan. 3:28). The king was ultimately impressed\nthat these three faithful followers of God had \u201cyielded their bodies\u201d in sacri-\nfice to the Lord.\n8. The human body is to be resurrected: \u201cAnd God both raised up the\nLord and will also raise us up by His power\u201d (1 Cor. 6:14). All humans will\nbe resurrected. Christians will live in resurrected, glorified bodies. This reveals\nthat our bodies are important to God both in this life and the life to come\n(1 Cor. 15:42).\n\nB. The vital relationship between the soul, spirit and body\nThe condition of the body affects the soul. Having a healthy body can\nlead to a cheerful disposition, while being sick can lead to sadness or even\ndepression. Likewise, the condition of the soul and spirit also affect the body.\nGood news can produce in people a feeling of physical exhilaration, while\nsad news can lead to physical fatigue. The condition of the soul, spirit and\nbody are interconnected. Therefore, God has made provision for all aspects\nof the human condition and cares about the spiritual and physical health of\nevery individual.\nC. The two-fold needs of humans\nHumans have two distinct natures. They are both material and spiri-\ntual beings. When Adam and Eve sinned, both parts of their nature were\naffected by their sin. All humanity has inherited this fallen nature as well.\nSin has brought corruption to the souls of humans and sickness and disease\nto their bodies. The complete plan of Christ\u2019s redemption includes the res-\ntoration of the spiritual life of individuals as well as the healing of the effects\nof sin in their physical bodies. In other words, redemption ultimately meets\nthe spiritual and physical needs of humanity. Jesus demonstrated this reality\nthrough healing the sick and shedding His blood for the forgiveness of sin.\nHe confirmed this truth in the commission He gave the disciples: \u201cGo into\nall the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is\nbaptized will be saved\u2026they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover\u201d\n(Mark 16:15-18).\nII. The Origin of Sickness\nIndividuals need a clear understanding of the origin of sickness to com-\nprehend the subject of divine healing. When people view sickness from God\u2019s\nperspective, they are more able to exercise faith to believe God for healing.\nThis section will show that sickness in the world is ultimately the result of\nsin and can be directly traced to the influence and power of Satan. Sin clearly\nexpresses itself through sickness in the human body. This does not mean that\n\nevery time individuals become sick it is because they have committed sin.\nHowever, it does mean that without sin in the world, there would be no\nsickness. In the following section, we will specifically focus on the historical,\nphysiological and corrective implications of sickness.\nA. Historical\nSickness entered the world through the sin of Adam and Eve. If humans,\nwho are made in the image of God, had never sinned, they certainly would\nnot have suffered pain, weakness and disease in their bodies. Paul made it\nclear that death is the result of sin: \u201cTherefore, just as through one man sin\nentered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men,\nbecause all sinned\u2026\u201d (Rom. 5:12). Death is sickness matured. Therefore,\nsickness must also be the result of sin. If sin was not in the world, there would\nbe no sickness. The general principle that sickness is the result of sin and the\ninfluence and power of Satan is illustrated in the following:\n1. Satan caused Job\u2019s affliction: \u201cSo Satan went out from the presence of\nthe Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the\ncrown of his head\u201d (Job 2:7). Job\u2019s affliction came from Satan, but his healing\ncame from God: \u201cAnd the Lord restored Job\u2019s losses when he prayed for his\nfriends\u201d (Job 42:10).\n2. Those Jesus healed were oppressed by the devil: \u201c...God anointed Jesus\nof Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing\ngood and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him\u201d\n(Acts 10:38).\n3. The woman who was infirm for eighteen years was bound by Satan:\n\u201cSo ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has\nbound\u2014think of it\u2014for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the\nSabbath?\u201d (Luke 13:16).\n4. There is enmity between Satan and the offspring of woman: \u201cAnd I\nwill put enmity Between you [the Serpent] and the woman, And between\nyour seed and her Seed\u2026\u201d (Gen. 3:15).\n\n5. The incestuous man in Corinth was turned over to Satan for the\ndestruction of the flesh: \u201c\u2026deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction\nof the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus\u201d (1 Cor.\n5:5). This passage implies that physical affliction would come upon this unre-\npentant man if he continued to serve Satan with his sinful behavior.\n6. Sickness is among the curses for not following God\u2019s commandments:\nThe children of Israel were warned that they would be cursed with various\nsicknesses and diseases if they sinned against God (Deut. 28:15-35).\n7. Paul\u2019s \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d was from Satan: \u201c\u2026a thorn in the flesh was\ngiven to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 12:7). Many believe\nPaul\u2019s \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d was a physical affliction Paul attributed to Satan.\n8. Satan is bound during the Millennium: \u201cHe laid hold of the dragon,\nthat serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thou-\nsand years; and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set\na seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thou-\nsand years were finished\u201d (Rev. 20:2-3). Scripture seems to reveal that during\nthe Millennium there will be no sickness on earth because Satan is bound:\n\u201cAnd the inhabitant will not say, \u2018I am sick\u2026\u2019\u201d (Isa. 33:24); \u201cThey shall not\nhurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain\u2026\u201d (Isa. 11:9); \u201c\u2026The Sun of\nRighteousness shall arise With healing in His wings\u2026\u201d (Mal. 4:2).\n9. Jesus rebuked sickness: \u201cBut Simon\u2019s wife\u2019s mother was sick with a high\nfever, and they made request of Him concerning her. So He stood over her\nand rebuked the fever, and it left her\u201d (Luke 4:38-39). Jesus cast out sickness\nthe same way He cast out demons when He considered an illness to be the\nwork of the devil.\nB. Physiological\n1. All sickness is ultimately the result of sin\nSin in the world has manifested itself through sickness in the human\nbody. This does not mean that every time individuals become sick it is the\n\nresult of their sinning. But it does mean that without sin in the world there\nwould be no sickness.\n2. Some sickness and afflictions are the result of specific sins\nJesus said to the man who was healed at the Pool of Bethesda, \u201cSin no\nmore, lest a worse thing come upon you\u201d (John 5:14). Certain sins are directly\nagainst the body and expose a person to diseases: \u201cThere is no soundness in my\nflesh Because of Your anger, Nor any health in my bones Because of my sin\u2026\nMy wounds are foul and festering Because of my foolishness\u2026For my loins are\nfull of inflammation, And there is no soundness in my flesh. I am feeble and\nseverely broken\u2026My heart pants, my strength fails me; As for the light of my\neyes, it also has gone from me\u201d (Ps. 38:3-10). Sin has the power to harm the\nhuman body: \u201cFor my life is spent with grief, And my years with sighing; My\nstrength fails because of my iniquity, And my bones waste away\u201d (Ps. 31:10).\n3. Scientific findings concerning sin and sickness\nScience has demonstrated that negative or sinful behaviors such as pro-\nlonged anger, hatred, fear or guilt can adversely affect the human body lead-\ning to health problems such as a weakened immune system, gastrointestinal\nissues and cardiovascular ailments. In some instances, a guilty or conflicted\nconscience can lead to both physical illness and mental anguish. It has also\nbeen demonstrated that individuals who have been severely sinned against or\nabused as children often struggle with psychological ailments such as clinical\ndepression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. It is clear that sin can\ndo harm to the human mind and body.\n4. Misuses of the body that lead to sickness\nMisuse of the body is sin and can lead to sickness. God gave Israel moral\nand dietary laws that were for the benefit of their bodies. It seems even the\nprinciple of the Sabbath was for the benefit of the human body: \u201c\u2026The\nSabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath\u201d (Mark 2:27; see\nalso Heb. 4:1-10). God desires that humans take good care of their bodies\n\nwith proper diet, appropriate physical activity and rest. Unhealthy eating,\noverworking and a lack of proper rest and exercise are all behaviors that can\nlead to sickness. When individuals don\u2019t take care of their bodies, they are\nsinning against themselves and God. The body of every Christian belongs\nto God; it is bought with a price, and it is the temple of the Holy Spirit.\nChristians should honor God by taking proper care of their bodies.\nC. Corrective\n1. Because of rebellion against God\nThroughout the Old Testament, God warned His children that rebellion\nwould lead to sickness: \u201cIf you do not carefully observe all the words of this\nlaw that are written in this book\u2026then the Lord will bring upon you and\nyour descendants extraordinary plagues\u2014great and prolonged plagues\u2014and\nserious and prolonged sicknesses. Moreover He will bring back on you all\nthe diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cling to you\u201d\n(Deut. 28:58-60; see also 28:15, 20-24; Exod. 15:26). The context of these\nscriptures suggests that God sometimes removes His protection against sick-\nness to demonstrate His displeasure with the sinful and rebellious activity of\nhumans. Ultimately, the purpose of this discipline is to lead people to obedi-\nence: \u201cThen it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and\nkeep and do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant\nand the mercy which He swore to your fathers\u2026And the Lord will take away\nfrom you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases\nof Egypt which you have known\u2026\u201d (Deut. 7:12-16). The goal of God\u2019s dis-\ncipline is not punishment but repentance: \u201cFools, because of their transgres-\nsion, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted\u2026And they drew near to\nthe gates of death. Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, And He\nsaved them out of their distresses. He sent His word and healed them, And\ndelivered them from their destructions\u201d (Ps. 107:17-20).\n2. Because of rebellion against God-appointed leaders\nSickness sometimes came upon individuals who refused to honor or fol-\nlow God\u2019s appointed leadership. Plagues came upon the children of Israel\n\nwhen they disobeyed and murmured against Moses (Num. 16:46-50). Even\nMiriam\u2019s criticism of her brother Moses led to sickness (Num. 12).\n3. Because of failure to rightly discern the Lord\u2019s body\nPaul said that in consuming the Lord\u2019s Supper, \u201c\u2026he who eats and\ndrinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not dis-\ncerning the Lord\u2019s body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you,\nand many sleep\u201d (1 Cor. 11:28-30). In this case, Paul believed that sickness\nand even death were the result of Corinthian believers not rightly discerning\nthe Lord\u2019s body in their observance of communion. He added, \u201cFor if we\nwould judge ourselves, we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we\nare chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world\u201d\n(1 Cor. 11:31-32). Ultimately, God disciplines individuals because He loves\nthem: \u201cMy son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor be discour-\naged when you are rebuked by Him; For whom the Lord loves He chas-\ntens\u2026\u201d (Heb. 12:5-6).\nSome of the afflictions Christians endure are the result of their own dis-\nobedience and sin. In praying for healing, these individuals need to repent of\ntheir disobedience and sin. Many individuals have become well the moment\nthey confessed their sin and asked God for forgiveness. Others have been\nhealed when they let go of their hatred and forgave the individuals who had\nwronged them.\nIII. The Spiritual Nature of Sickness\nSome individuals make too great of a distinction between sin and sick-\nness. They look at sin from a spiritual point of view, while they deal with\nsickness only through natural means. However, Scripture demonstrates that\nsickness has a spiritual significance. If sickness has a spiritual component,\nthen the spiritual remedy of divine healing is needed. The following is a\nbrief summation of what has already been presented concerning the spiritual\nnature of physical sickness:\n\n\u2022 Sickness is in the world because of sin and the activity of Satan:\nSatan is a spiritual being, and sin occurs in the spiritual realm.\nTherefore, the original source of sickness is spiritual.\n\u2022 Some sicknesses are the result of specific sin: Certain sicknesses\nare known to be the direct result of engaging in specific sinful\nbehaviors. These physical ailments have spiritual significance\nbecause there is a close relationship between the sickness and the\nsin.\n\u2022 Some sickness is a form of discipline or correction: God sometimes\nallows sickness as a disciplinary measure for those He loves. These\nsicknesses have spiritual significance because their purpose is to lead\nindividuals to repentance and spiritual transformation.\nIf sickness has a spiritual cause, then there must also be a spiritual cure.\nThis means that individuals need to look at both the physical and spiritual\naspects of sickness. For instance, a physician\u2019s remedy may alleviate the physi-\ncal symptoms of sickness, but it might not address the spiritual causes behind\nthose physical symptoms. In contrast, a healthy theology of divine healing\nwill examine the physical needs of an individual from a spiritual perspec-\ntive. For example, a number of passages in the Bible address the relationship\nbetween the forgiveness of sins and the healing of diseases:\n\u2022 \u201c\u2026Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases\u2026\u201d\n(Ps. 103:3).\n\u2022 \u201cAnd the inhabitant will not say, \u2018I am sick\u2019; The people who dwell\nin it will be forgiven their iniquity\u201d (Isa. 33:24).\n\u2022 \u201cAnd the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him\nup. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven\u201d (James 5:15).\nThese passages show the interrelationship between the great spiritual\nblessing of the forgiveness of sins and the ministry of healing. In this case, if\n\npeople only focused on a natural, physical remedy to sickness, they would not\nhave the opportunity to experience the true joy of forgiveness and the power\nof God\u2019s loving touch. Anything that falls short of meeting the spiritual needs\nbehind physical sickness is not a sufficient or complete cure.\nIV. Healing and the will of God\nTo minister and receive divine healing, it is important to have a clear\nunderstanding of God\u2019s will concerning healing. The central issue is whether\nor not it is God\u2019s will to heal individuals who come to Him for healing. The\nquestion is not about God\u2019s ability to heal. Every Christian believes that God\nhas the ability to do anything He chooses to accomplish. Even many who\nmake no profession of faith still believe in a God that can perform miracles.\nThe question is not about God\u2019s ability to heal but His willingness to heal\nthose who earnestly seek Him. This is an important issue to address because it\nwill influence the manner in which we pray and seek healing. A poor under-\nstanding of God\u2019s will may lead some to accept circumstances that are not part\nof God\u2019s plan. Instead of praying and believing for healing, individuals might\nbecome fatalistic in their thinking, assuming that it is God\u2019s will that they\nface perpetual misery, sickness and sadness. Unfortunately, some individuals\nview every state or condition in life as simply the will of God to be accepted.\nBecause of this errant view of God\u2019s will, they do not seek God\u2019s transforma-\ntional healing. Kenneth MacKenzie addressed this inaccurate notion of God\u2019s\nwill when he wrote the following:\nThe will of God has been a deep shadow on their pathway,\nobscuring the light of present blessing with its possible\ndecrees of sorrow. It has been a skeleton in their closet,\nwhich they have prayed to stay behind closed doors. It\nhas been a presence from whose cold embrace they have\npleaded to be released. Their dread of His will has impelled\nthem to school themselves to be ready for its visitation\nas for the pestilence that sweeps through the land. The\nwill of God is associated with sick rooms, poverty, loss,\nbereavement, funerals, the open grave. The will of God,\n\nto such, is always dressed in black. And this conception\nof His will gives us sickly Christians, weak faith, empty\njoy, puny conquests. With many, no thought of the will\nof God is given until some calamity presses into their lives\nand then they awake to such sad surmisings as we have\nnoted. When we say, in prayer, \u201cThy will be done,\u201d are we\nalways impressed with its significance? God\u2019s will is not a\nvindictive judge, exercising the keen scrutiny of inevita-\nble retribution. Ah, how we have placed a libel upon our\nFather\u2019s great heartedness in all these miserable thoughts\nof Him! His will is a blessed companion, which illumines\nour way, cheers our spirits, makes glad our lives and brings\nfruitfulness to all that we do.2\nSo what is God\u2019s will concerning healing? Is He willing to heal, and is\nhealing a part of His plan for humanity today? It is important to find the\nscriptural answers to these questions so that individuals can exercise the\nproper faith for healing. F.F. Bosworth stated: \u201cIt is impossible to boldly claim\nby faith a blessing which we are not sure God offers, because the power of\nGod can be claimed only where the will of God is known... Faith begins\nwhere the will of God is known.\u201d3 Some, when petitioning God for healing,\nadd the words \u201cif it be Your will.\u201d A man with leprosy came to Christ with a\nsimilar petition saying, \u201c...\u2018Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.\u2019\nThen He [Jesus] put out His hand and touched him, saying, \u2018I am willing; be\ncleansed.\u2019 Immediately the leprosy left him\u201d (Luke 5:12-13). The \u201cI am will-\ning\u201d of Christ answered the \u201cIf You are willing\u201d of the leper. Christ\u2019s response\nto the man with leprosy demonstrates that it is God\u2019s will to heal those who\nseek Him by faith. In another instance, a man brought to Jesus his son who\nhad been tormented by a mute and violent spirit from childhood. After the\ndisciples were unable to cast out the spirit, the man said to Jesus, \u201c\u2018But if You\ncan do anything, have compassion on us and help us.\u2019 Jesus said to him, \u2018If\nyou can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.\u2019 Immediately\nthe father of the child cried out and said with tears, \u2018Lord, I believe; help my\n2 Kenneth MacKenzie, Divine Life for the Body (Brooklyn, NY: Christian Alliance Publishing Company, n.d.)\n32-33.\n3 Fred Francis Bosworth, Christ the Healer: Message on Divine Healing {Miami Beach, 1948) 7th edition, 33.\n\nunbelief!\u2019\u201d (Mark 9:22-24). In response to the man\u2019s confession of faith, Jesus\ncast out the \u201cdeaf and dumb spirit\u201d from the boy and restored him to health\n(Mark 9:25-27). In both these instances, Jesus demonstrated that it is not\nnecessary to ask God \u201cif it be Your will\u201d when seeking healing. Instead, indi-\nviduals should exercise the faith they have been given by trusting the leading\nof Jesus and receiving the healing He provides. Scripture states, \u201cJesus Christ\nis the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8). Therefore, the sick can\napproach Jesus with the same faith and expectation today as they did in the\nBible. It is the will of Jesus to heal.\nEvery sincere Christian should want God\u2019s will for his or her life. The\nWord of God declares that healing has been purchased and promised to every\nbeliever. God is unchanging; therefore, believers can and should boldly ask\nthe Lord to heal them on the basis of God\u2019s promises in Scripture and God\u2019s\nleading through the Holy Spirit. It is not necessary to doubt what God has\npromised. Just as individuals pray \u201cLord save us,\u201d they should also pray \u201cLord\nheal us.\u201d There is no need to add \u201cif it is Your will.\u201d It is God\u2019s will to save\nand God\u2019s will to heal. To effectively pray, individuals must exercise the faith\nthey have been given.\nGod is good. He brings blessings and healing to His children. John wrote,\n\u201cBeloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as\nyour soul prospers\u201d (3 John 1:2). Paul most assuredly had the whole bless-\ning of God in mind when he wrote, \u201cNow may the God of peace Himself\nsanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be pre-\nserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (1 Thess. 5:23). It\nis God\u2019s desire to heal; therefore, His children should earnestly seek to receive\nHis healing.\nThe Scripture is full of examples concerning God\u2019s will and healing.\nThroughout Scripture, in every age, physical health and healing have been\npart of God\u2019s plan for His people. Those who believed God\u2019s word and obeyed\nGod\u2019s promises enjoyed the blessing of healing. The following section will\nlook at the provision God has made for the healing of His people throughout\nevery period of recorded human history.\n\nV. Scriptural Support of Divine Healing\nA. Divine healing in the Old Testament\nThere are many significant examples of healing in the Old Testament.\nThe first recorded case of divine healing in the Bible revolves around the life of\nAbraham: \u201cSo Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife,\nand his female servants. Then they bore children; for the Lord had closed up\nall the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham\u2019s wife\u201d\n(Gen. 20:17-18). Shortly after the Israelites escaped from Egypt and crossed\nthe Red Sea, before they began their long journey to the Promised Land,\nGod gave the Israelites what some refer to as the Old Testament covenant of\ndivine healing:\nThere He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and\nthere He tested them, and said, \u201cIf you diligently heed\nthe voice of the LORD your God and do what is right\nin His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all\nHis statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I\nhave brought on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who\nheals you\u201d (Exod. 15:25-26).\nThe words \u201cthere He made a statute and an ordinance\u201d indicate that this\nwas more than a passing promise for an individual situation. This was to be a\nstatute and ordinance incorporated into the very life of God\u2019s people. In fact,\nHe put one of His redemptive names, Yahweh Rapha, right into the promise.\nLiterally, God said, \u201cI am the LORD your Healer.\u201d God\u2019s promise to heal still\napplies today, for God\u2019s name is Yahweh, which is literally translated \u201cI AM\u201d\nor \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d God\u2019s name is not \u201cI WAS\u201d as though to indicate His\npromises are left in the past. He is \u201cI AM,\u201d indicating His great and eternally\nunchanging nature. God revealed His name as Yahweh to Moses, Pharaoh\nand the children of Israel:\nThen Moses said to God, \u201cIndeed, when I come to the\nchildren of Israel and say to them, \u2018The God of your\nfathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they say to me, \u2018What\n\nis His name?\u2019 what shall I say to them?\u201d And God said\nto Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d And He said, \u201cThus you\nshall say to the children of Israel, \u2018I AM has sent me to\nyou\u2019\u201d (Exod. 3:13-14).\nJesus said this same great name when speaking to the Jews: \u201cMost assur-\nedly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58). Hebrews states,\n\u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8). From\nthese scriptures, it is clear that it is God\u2019s will to heal the sick and fulfill His\npromises. Psalm 105:37 testifies to this truth: \u201cHe also brought them out\nwith silver and gold, And there was none feeble among His tribes.\u201d\nThe Old Testament gives various examples of rebellion leading to sick-\nness. Yet even in these stories, we see God powerfully fulfilling His promise\nto heal. When Miriam grieved the Lord by criticizing the leadership of her\nbrother Moses, she became leprous (Num. 12:1-10). However, when Miriam\nrepented, and Moses prayed to God to heal her, she was delivered (Num.\n12:11-14). In response to her rebellion, God showed that He was still Yahweh\nRapha, the LORD your Healer. A similar event happened when a plague\nbegan to destroy a great number of Israelites who had sinned against God by\nrebelling against the leadership of Moses and Aaron (Num. 16:41-50). After\nthey repented, the Lord showed His mercy by healing them and stopping\nthe plague.\nLater in their journey to go around the land of Edom, the Israelites\n\u201cbecame very discouraged on the way. And the people spoke against God and\nagainst Moses\u2026So the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they\nbit the people; and many of the people of Israel died\u201d (Num. 21:4-6). Once\nagain, the people repented, and God healed all who looked at the bonze ser-\npent, which Moses had made at God\u2019s command (Num. 21:7-9). Jesus used\nthis story of the bronze serpent to explain His ministry: \u201cAnd as Moses lifted\nup the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,\nthat whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John\n3:14). As God healed the Israelites in the wilderness, Christ became the healer\nof all who look to Him.\n\nThe following are other Old Testament scriptures that show God\u2019s will-\ningness to heal the sick:\n\u2022 \u201cSo you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your\nbread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst\nof you\u201d (Exod. 23:25).\n\u2022 \u201cAnd the Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict\nyou with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have\nknown, but will lay them on all those who hate you\u201d (Deut. 7:15).\n\u2022 \u201c\u2026that you may love the Lord your God, that you may obey His\nvoice, and that you may cling to Him, for He is your life and the\nlength of your days; and that you may dwell in the land which the\nLord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give\nthem\u201d (Deut. 30:20).\n\u2022 \u201cMany are the afflictions of the righteous, But the Lord delivers\nhim out of them all\u201d (Ps. 34:19).\n\u2022 \u201cBecause you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the\nMost High, your dwelling place, No evil shall befall you, Nor shall\nany plague come near your dwelling\u201d (Ps. 91:9-10).\n\u2022 \u201cBless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: Who\nforgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases\u2026\u201d (Ps.\n103:2-3).\n\u2022 \u201cHe sent His word and healed them, And delivered them from\ntheir destructions\u201d (Ps. 107:20).\n\u2022 \u201cDo not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from\nevil. It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones\u201d\n(Prov. 3:7-8).\n\nOther Old Testament examples of healing:\n\u2022 Miriam healed from leprosy (Num. 12:12-15)\n\u2022 People healed from the plague (2 Sam. 24:25; Num. 16)\n\u2022 A widow\u2019s son raised from the dead (1 Kings 17:17-24)\n\u2022 The Shunamite woman\u2019s son raised from the dead (2 Kings 4:18-37)\n\u2022 Naaman healed from leprosy (2 Kings 5:1-15)\n\u2022 Hezekiah\u2019s life extended fifteen years (2 Kings 20:1-11)\n\u2022 Job healed of his sore affliction (Job 42:10-13)\nThese scriptures and others demonstrate that Yahweh was the physician\nand healer of the Israelites. Even though there are many examples of God\nhealing in the Old Testament, some may ask: \u201cDoes God\u2019s provision of heal-\ning apply only to the nation of Israel or to all nations?\u201d \u201cIs this provision of\nhealing available today?\u201d The answer to these important questions is found\nin the study of the compound names of Yahweh. The names of God express\nHis character and purpose. Some aspects of God\u2019s plan never change because\nthey are manifestations of His very nature. Some activities of God never cease\nbecause they are a result of His very character. In other words, God does\nwhat He does because He is who He is: \u201cFor I am the LORD: I do not\nchange\u2026\u201d (Mal. 3:6). James expressed the unchanging character of God this\nway: \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down\nfrom the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turn-\ning\u201d (James 1:17). The name Yahweh is the name God uses when addressing\nHis covenant with His people. It expresses that He is the eternal, self-exis-\ntent, unchanging God. The Bible uses seven different compound names that\ninclude the name Yahweh. These names reveal the nature of God\u2019s covenant\nwith Israel. However, because God never changes, these names also reveal His\n\nredemptive relationship with His people today. The following are the seven\ncompound, redemptive names of Yahweh:\n\u2022 Yahweh Jireh: \u201cThe Lord will provide\u201d (Gen. 22:14)\n\u2022 Yahweh Nissi: \u201cThe Lord our Banner\u201d (Exod. 17:8-15)\n\u2022 Yahweh Shalom: \u201cThe Lord our Peace\u201d (Judg. 6:24)\n\u2022 Yahweh Raah: \u201cThe Lord our Shepherd\u201d (Ps. 23:1)\n\u2022 Yahweh Tsidkenu: \u201cThe Lord our Righteousness\u201d (Jer. 23:6)\n\u2022 Yahweh Shammah: \u201cThe Lord is Present\u201d (Ezek. 48:35)\n\u2022 Yahweh Rapha: \u201cThe Lord our Healer\u201d (Ex. 15:26)\nThe nature and character of Yahweh is the same as the nature and charac-\nter of Jesus. The Old Testament prophesied this truth concerning the coming\nof Messiah: \u201cThe voice of one crying in the wilderness: \u2018Prepare the way of\nthe Lord [Yahweh]; Make straight in the desert A highway for our God\u2019\u201d\n(Isa. 40:3). The New Testament reveals that John the Baptist fulfilled this\nprophecy: \u201cFor this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:\n\u2018The voice of one crying in the wilderness: \u2018Prepare the way of the Lord;\nMake His paths straight\u2019\u201d (Matt. 3:3). John understood that \u201cthe way of the\nLord\u201d [Yahweh] prophesied in Isaiah was to be fulfilled and revealed by Jesus.\nJeremiah also confirms the unity of the ministry of Yahweh and the ministry\nof Jesus: \u201c\u2018Behold, the days are coming,\u2019 says the Lord [Yahweh], \u2018That I will\nraise to David a Branch of righteousness; A King shall reign and prosper, And\nexecute judgment and righteousness in the earth. In His days Judah will be\nsaved, And Israel will dwell safely; Now this is His name by which He will\nbe called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS [Yahweh Tsidkenu]\u2019\u201d (Jer.\n23:5-6). The New Testament reveals that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of this\nprophecy. Jesus is the King who reigns on the throne of David. Jesus is the\nLord our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30).\n\nYahweh never changes. His name reveals that what He has been He will\nalways be. Each of the seven compound names of Yahweh reveal some aspect\nof God\u2019s eternal relationship with His people. Jesus Christ also reveals these\nsame aspects to His church. The following are parallels between God\u2019s work\nwith Israel and God\u2019s work with the church through Christ Jesus:\nYahweh to Israel Meaning / Emphasis\nYahweh Jireh: \u201cThe-Lord- Jesus our provider: \u201cAnd my God shall supply\nWill-Provide\u201d (Gen. 22:14) all your need according to His riches in glory by\nChrist Jesus\u201d (Phil. 4:19).\nYahweh Nissi: \u201cThe-Lord-Is- Jesus our banner: \u201c\u2026his banner over me was\nMy-Banner\u201d (Exod. 17:15) love\u201d (Song of Sol. 2:4). \u201cGreater love has no\none than this, than to lay down one\u2019s life for his\nfriends\u201d (John 15:13).\nYahweh Shalom: \u201cThe-Lord-Is- Jesus our peace: \u201cFor He Himself is our peace\u2026\u201d\nPeace\u201d (Judg. 6:24) (Eph. 2:14).\nYahweh Raah: \u201cThe Lord is Jesus is our shepherd: \u201cI am the good shepherd\u201d\nmy shepherd\u201d (Ps. 23:1) (John 10:11).\nYahweh Tsidkenu: Jesus is our righteousness: \u201c\u2026Christ Jesus, who\n\u201cTHE LORD OUR became for us\u2026righteousness\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 1:30).\nRIGHTEOUSNESS\u201d (Jer.\n23:6)\nYahweh Shammah: \u201cTHE Jesus is there/present: \u201cFor He Himself has said,\nLORD IS THERE\u201d (Ezek. \u2018I will never leave you nor forsake you\u2019\u201d (Heb.\n48:35) 13:5).\nYahweh Rapha: \u201cThe Lord Jesus is our healer: \u201cAnd the prayer of faith will\nwho heals\u201d (Exod. 15:26) save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And\nif he has committed sins, he will be forgiven\u201d\n(James 5:15).\nThere can be no doubt that it was God\u2019s will to heal His people in\nOld Testament times. However, it is important to remember that God has\nremained constant throughout all the ages. In Christ, God is still our provider,\nour banner, our peace, our shepherd, our ever-present one, our righteousness\nand our healer. God has demonstrated His unchanging nature through His\n\nrevealed names and in the ministry of Jesus Christ. God\u2019s promise of healing\nwas for the Israelites, and it is also for the church today. For in Christ, God is\nthe great physician: \u201c\u2026the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8).\nB. Healing in the ministry of Jesus\nThe following section will look at healing in the New Testament through\nthe ministry of Jesus. There is certainly no better way to find God\u2019s will\nregarding physical healing than by closely studying the ministry and teach-\nings of Jesus. Jesus expressed the Father\u2019s will. In His ministry on earth, Jesus\nonly spoke and did the will of God. Jesus said, \u201cFor I have come down from\nheaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me\u201d (John\n6:38). Jesus Christ literally embodied and lived the will of God the Father.\nTherefore, when Jesus healed the multitudes that came to Him, He was\nrevealing the Father\u2019s will to heal. Jesus said, \u201cDo you not believe that I am\nin the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not\nspeak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works\u201d\n(John 14:10). Therefore, when Jesus healed the sick, He was revealing God\u2019s\nwill for humanity. Thomas Holdcroft, concluded:\nA total of twenty-seven individual miracles of healing\ncredited to Jesus are to be found in the Scriptures, as well\nas ten occasions recording the general healing of large\nnumbers of people. His ministry dealt with a wide variety\nof human ailments: demon possession, sickness, disease,\naccident, and even death... In each instance, Jesus freely\nand frankly presented Himself as an object of faith to be\nsincerely believed. In the face of such an impressive minis-\ntry of healing, it is truly remarkable that He should prom-\nise His disciples, \u201cGreater works than these shall [ye] do\u201d\n(John 14:12). In ministering to physical needs, our Lord\nhealed by a word, by a touch, and by physical anointing;\nHe healed those near at hand and at a distance; He healed\non the Sabbath; He healed both individuals and groups at\nlarge. Among the twenty-seven instances of healing, there\nare seven cases in which a demon was cast out; on eleven\n\noccasions friends brought the sufferer; on six occasions the\npatient himself made an appeal; on three occasions our\nLord performed the healing while at a distance. He healed\neight persons by a touch; He healed seven by speaking a\nword; three were healed in a ceremony in which He spat\nand touched the patient, and in one instance He healed\nby effecting a gradual cure (John 4:52\u2014\u201cHe began to\namend,\u201d ASV).4\nThe following are lists of the healings performed by Jesus during His\nministry on earth recorded in the four Gospels:\nHealings Narrated in One Gospel Only\nIncident of Healing Matthew Mark Luke John\nTwo blind men 9:27-31\nMute demoniac 9:32-33\nDeaf and mute man 7:31-37\nBlind man 8:22-26\nWidow\u2019s dead son 7:11-16\nWoman bent over 13:11-17\nMan with dropsy 14:1-6\nTen lepers 17:11-19\nSevered ear of servant of high 22:50-51\npriest\nNobleman\u2019s sick son 4:46-54\nMan with infirmity at pool of 5:1-15\nBethesda\nMan born blind 9:1-38\nLazarus dead and in the tomb 11:1-45\n4 Leslie Thomas Holdcroft, Divine Healing: a Comparative Study (Springfield, MO: Gospel Publishing House,\n1967) 13-14.\n\nHealings Narrated in Two Gospels\nIncident of Healing Matthew Mark Luke John\nDemoniac in synagogue 1:23-27 4:33-36\nCenturion\u2019s paralyzed servant 8:5-13 7:1-10\nBlind and mute demoniac 12:22-23 11:14\nSyro-Phoenician woman\u2019s 15:21-28 7:24-30\ndaughter\nMary Magdalene demonized 16:9 8:2\nHealings Narrated in Three Gospels\nIncident of Healing Matthew Mark Luke John\nLeprous man 8:2-4 1:40-45 5:12-15\nPeter\u2019s mother-in-law sick with 8:14-15 1:29-31 4:38-39\nfever\nMan with a legion of demons 8:28-34 5:1-20 8:26-39\nParalytic man 9:2-8 2:1-12 5:17-26\nWoman with issue of blood 9:20-22 5:25-34 8:43-48\nJairus\u2019 dead daughter 9:23-26 5:35-43 8:49-56\nMan in synagogue with 12:9-13 3:1-5 6:6-11\nwithered hand\nChild with a demon 17:14-21 9:14-29 9:37-43\nBlind Bartimaeus (two blind 20:29-34 10:46-52 18:35-43\nmen in Matthew)\nIn addition to these examples, there are other occasions when Jesus\nhealed many at one time (see Matt. 4:23-25; 8:16; 12:15; 14:14; 14:34-36;\n15:30; 19:2; 21:14; Luke 6:17-19). In these instances, \u201cmultitudes\u201d came or\nwere brought to Jesus for healing. Scripture repeatedly uses certain phrases\nto describe the vast extent of Jesus\u2019 healing ministry: He \u201chealed all who\nwere sick,\u201d \u201chealed them all,\u201d \u201chealed their sick,\u201d \u201cas many as touched it\n[the hem of His garment] were made perfectly well.\u201d Although this list of\nmiracles is incredibly impressive, it is not exhaustive. John noted: \u201cAnd truly\nJesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not\nwritten in this book\u201d (John 20:30). In fact, John concluded his gospel with\n\nthis powerful testimony: \u201cAnd there are also many other things that Jesus did,\nwhich if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself\ncould not contain the books that would be written. Amen\u201d (John 21:25).\nThe fact that Jesus healed every person who came to Him or was brought\nto Him for healing is a remarkable truth worthy of deeper consideration. In\naddition to dealing with a great variety of individual needs, Jesus also had a\nmultitude of sick people regularly brought to Him for healing. Even so, He\nnever turned anyone away. He never refused to heal anyone. He never told\nindividuals that it was not His will or the Father\u2019s will to heal them. In every\nrecorded instance, Jesus healed those who came to Him or were brought to\nHim for healing. It is clear from the testimony of Scripture that Christians are\nto seek and expect the healing touch of Jesus.\nC. Healing in the ministry of the disciples\nHealing was and is such a crucial part of God\u2019s will that He extended\nthe ministry of healing to the disciples of Jesus, giving them power to heal\nthe sick, raise the dead and cast out demons. While Jesus ministered in the\nflesh on earth, His ministry influence was limited to being present with those\nneeding healing or seeking healing for someone else. To expand the influence\nof His ministry, the disciples were given the ability to heal the sick: \u201cAnd\nwhen He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over\nunclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds\nof disease\u201d (Matt. 10:1).\n1. The twelve given power and sent out\nAnd when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He\ngave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out,\nand to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease\u2026\nThese twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, say-\ning\u2026\u201cAnd as you go, preach, saying, \u2018The kingdom of\nheaven is at hand.\u2019 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise\n\nthe dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely\ngive\u201d (Matt. 10:1-8; see also Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).\n2. The seventy given power and sent out\nAfter these things the Lord appointed seventy others also,\nand sent them two by two before His face into every city\nand place where He Himself was about to go. Then He\nsaid\u2026\u201cAnd heal the sick there, and say to them, \u2018The\nkingdom of God has come near to you\u2019\u201d (Luke 10:1-9).\nThe powerful results of this commission were quite evident: \u201cThen the\nseventy returned with joy, saying, \u2018Lord, even the demons are subject to us in\nYour name\u2019\u201d (Luke 10:17). Jesus was not surprised by this report:\nAnd He [Jesus] said to them, \u201cI saw Satan fall like light-\nning from heaven. Behold, I give you the authority to\ntrample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power\nof the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\nNevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are sub-\nject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are writ-\nten in heaven\u201d (Luke 10:18-20).\nJesus\u2019 instructions to His disciples reveal that it is God\u2019s will to heal not\njust a few but many. Jesus told the disciples, \u201cFreely you have received, freely\ngive\u201d (Matt. 10:8). In other words, they were to freely minister the power\nthey had been given to anyone seeking healing. It seems clear that the power\ngiven the twelve and the seventy is also the same power Jesus promised the\nchurch would receive on the Day of Pentecost (John 14:16-17; Luke 24:49;\nActs 1:8).\nD. Healing in the early church\nLuke began the book of Acts by mentioning his former book, the gospel\nof Luke, in which he gave an account of \u201call that Jesus began both to do and\n\nteach\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:1). The phrase \u201call that Jesus began both to do and teach\u201d cer-\ntainly includes the ministry of healing. It also implies that what Jesus \u201cbegan\u201d\nto do He continued to do after returning to the Father. The book of Acts is an\ninspired account of the continued ministry of Jesus expressed through Spirit-\nempowered believers. While the gospel of Luke recorded the miracles Jesus\nperformed while He lived on earth, the book of Acts recorded the miracles\nJesus performed through the church, which is His body. Acts shows that Jesus\ncontinued to heal the sick through the church after His ascension.\nAll Christians are members of the body of Christ. Jesus Christ is the\nmotivating, living head of His body. Therefore, what Christ did while He\nwas bodily present on the earth He now does through the members of His\nspiritual body. For example, when Peter and John stood before a lame man at\nthe Beautiful Gate of the temple, Peter said, \u201cIn the name of Jesus Christ of\nNazareth, rise up and walk\u201d (Acts 3:6). Peter then took the lame man \u201c\u2026by\nthe hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received\nstrength\u201d (Acts 3:7). Through Peter, a member of Christ\u2019s body, Jesus reached\nout and healed the lame man. Through Peter, Jesus ministered healing in the\nsame way as if He had been physically present. In response to this miracle,\nthe multitudes rushed to Solomon\u2019s Porch \u201cgreatly amazed\u201d at the miracle.\nPeter said to the people: \u201cMen of Israel, why do you marvel at this?...The God\nof Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant\nJesus\u2026whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. And His\nname, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see\nand know\u201d (Acts 3:12-16). By this statement, Peter was proclaiming, \u201cJesus\nis alive. He is not dead. Therefore, He is still manifesting the same power and\nmiracles He performed before He was crucified.\u201d This is the true picture of\nChristian ministry: the living Christ, ministering healing through His body,\nthe church. The following are examples of healing in the book of Acts:\n\u2022 The lame man healed through Peter (Acts 3:1-10)\n\u2022 Many healed through Peter (Acts 5:12-16)\n\u2022 Wonders and miracles performed through Stephen (Acts 6:8)\n\n\u2022 Revival in Samaria through Philip (Acts 8:5-8)\n\u2022 Aeneas healed through Peter (Acts 9:32-35)\n\u2022 Tabitha (Dorcas) raised from the dead through Peter (Acts 9:36-42)\n\u2022 Crippled man at Lystra healed through Paul (Acts 14:8-10)\n\u2022 Paul raised up at Lystra through the disciples (Acts 14:19-20)\n\u2022 Slave girl freed from spirit of divination through Paul (Acts 16:16-\n18)\n\u2022 God worked unusual miracles through Paul (Acts 19:11-12)\n\u2022 Eutychus brought back to life through Paul (Acts 20:7-12)\n\u2022 Father of Publius and the sick on the island of Malta healed\nthrough Paul (Acts 28:8-9)\nThis same provision for healing that we see in the book of Acts is still\navailable for people today. Christ died and rose from the grave. He is alive\ntoday. He has poured out the Holy Spirit to empower believers to continue\nto carry out His Great Commission. Sin still ravages the world today causing\npain, sickness and suffering. Many are in need of healing. The Bible gives no\nindication that God has ever altered His will concerning healing. God was, is\nand will always be Yahweh Rapha, \u201cthe Lord who heals you\u201d (Exod. 15:26).\nVI. Divine Healing through the Church Age\nDr. Gerhard Uhlhorn said, \u201cWitnesses who are above suspicion leave no\nroom for doubt that the miraculous powers of the apostolic age continued to\n\noperate at least into the third century.\u201d5 Dr. A.J. Gordon made the following\nimportant comment concerning Uhlhorn\u2019s observation:\nProve that Miracles were wrought, for example, in the sec-\nond century after Christ, and no reason can be thereafter\nurged why they might not be wrought in the nineteenth\n[and we add \u201cthe twentieth\u201d] century. The apostolic age, it\nmust be admitted, was a peculiarly favored one. So long as\nthe men were still living who had seen the Lord, and had\ncompanied with Him during His earthly ministry, there\nwere possible secrets of power in their possession that a\nlater generation might not have. It is easy to see, therefore,\nthat this period might be especially distinguished by the\ngifts of the Spirit. And yet the Savior seems to be careful\nto teach that there would be an augmenting rather than\na diminishing of supernatural energy after His departure.\n\u201cBut ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is\ncome upon you.\u201d \u201cVerily, verily I say unto you, he that\nbelieveth on me the works that I do shall he do also, and\ngreater works than these shall he do; because I go unto\nmy Father.\u201d But, conceding certain marked advantages\npossessed by the immediate followers of Christ, if we find\nin history that there is no abrupt termination of miracles\nwith expiration of the apostolic age, then we must begin\nto raise the question why there should be any termination\nat all, so long as the Church remains, and the ministry of\nthe Spirit is perpetuated.6\nHistory shows that healing by the direct power of God continued through\nthe early church age right up to present times. The testimonies of the church\nfathers and revered church leaders reveal that healing continued beyond the\nNew Testament age.\n5 Dr. Gerhard Uhlhorn. Conflict of Christianity with Heathenism, 196, as quoted in Adoniram Judson Gordon,\nMinistry of Healing (Harrisburg, PA: Christian Publications) 58.\n6 Gordon, 58-59.\n\nA. Justin Martyr (A.D. 100-165)\nIn A.D. 165, more than sixty-five years after the death of John, the last of\nthe original twelve apostles, Justin Martyr wrote the following:\nFor numberless demoniacs throughout the whole world\nand in your city, many of our Christian men, exorcising\nthem [casting out] in the name of Jesus Christ, who was\ncrucified under Pontius Pilate, have healed, and do heal,\nrendering helpless and driving the possessing devils out of\nmen, though they could not be cured by all the other exor-\ncists, and those who used incantations and drugs.7\nB. Clement of Alexandria (A.D. 150-215)\nClement of Alexandria wrote:\nLet them [young ministers], therefore, with fasting and prayer, make\ntheir intercessions, and not with well arranged, and fifty ordered\nwords of learning, but as men who have received the gift of healing\nconfidently, to the glory of God.8\nC. Irenaeus (early 2nd century-A.D. 202)\nIn A.D. 192, Irenaeus declared the following:\nThose who are in truth the disciples receiving grace from Him do in\nHis name perform miracles so as to promote the welfare of others,\naccording to the gift which each has received from him\u2026Others still\nheal the sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made\nwhole. Yea morever, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up,\nand remained among us for years.9\n7 Justin Martyr, Apol., 1, Ch. 6, as quoted in Gordon, 60.\n8 Clement of Alexandria, Epis. C., XII, as quoted in Gordon, 61.\n9 Irenaeus, Versus Heretics, 1, Ch. 34. as quoted in Gordon, 60.\n\nD. Tertullian (A.D. 155-240)\nIn A.D. 216, Tertullian wrote:\nFor the clerk of one of them who was liable to be thrown upon the\nground by an evil spirit was set free from his affliction, as was also the\nrelative of another, and the little boy of a third. And how many men\nof rank, to say nothing of the common people have been delivered\nfrom devils and healed of diseases.10\nE. Origen (A.D. 185-254)\nIn A.D. 250, Origen testified to the following:\nAnd some give evidence of their having received through their faith\na marvelous power by the cures which they perform, invoking no\nother name over those who need their help than that of the God\nof all things, and of Jesus\u2026For by these means we too have seen\nmany persons freed from grievous calamities, and from distractions\nof mind, madness, and countless other ills which could be cured\nneither by men or devils.11\nF. Theodore of Mopsuestia (A.D. 350-428)\nTheodore of Mopsuestia declared, \u201cMany heathen amongst us are being\nhealed by Christians from whatever sickness they have, so abundant are mir-\nacles in our midst.\u201d12\nG. Augustine of Canterbury (first third of 6th century-A.D. 604)\nAugustine was a missionary sent from Rome to establish the English church.\nSo many miraculous events occurred during Augustine\u2019s work that in A.D. 601,\n10 Tertullian, Ad. Scap., IV, 4, as quoted in Gordon, 60-6l.\n11 Origen, Contra Celsurn B., III, Ch. 24, as quoted in Gordon, 61.\n12 Theodore of Mopsueste, Christlieb: Modern Doubt, p. 321, as quoted in Gordon, 61.\n\nGregory the Great, the bishop of Rome, sent Augustine a letter admonishing\nhim not to become prideful because of the miracles that were occurring through\nhis ministry: \u201cI know, most loving brother, that Almighty God, by means of your\naffection, shows great miracles in the nation which he has chosen. Wherefore it\nis necessary that you rejoice with fear, and tremble whilst you rejoice, on account\nof the same heavenly gift; viz., that you may rejoice because the souls of the\nEnglish are by outward miracles drawn to inward grace.\u201d13\nH. Church Leaders of the Middle Ages or Dark Ages (6th -14th century)\nScholars have used the term Dark Ages to refer to the cultural, economic,\ndemographic and moral decline that occurred between the 6th and 14th cen-\ntury. After Gregory the Great until the Reformation, the world went through\na dark age, both in respect to the progress of spiritual things and the advance-\nment of learning. Although God has certainly been at work in every age,\nthere have been ages when church leadership has been more resistant to God\u2019s\nmiraculous power. Speaking of the period after Constantine, John Wesley\nsaid: \u201cThe grand reason why the miraculous gifts were so soon withdrawn\nwas not only that Faith and Holiness were well nigh lost, but that dry formal\northodox men began to ridicule whatever gifts they had not in themselves,\nand to decry them all as either madness or impostures.\u201d14 However, even\nduring these dark times, there were still people who believed in and made\nroom for God\u2019s miraculous power.\nI. Peter Waldo (A.D. 1140-1218)\nPeter Waldo was a mendicant preacher who founded a deeply spiritual\nChristian sect that eventually became known as the Waldenses. The following\nis an excerpt from The Confessions of Faith of the Waldenses:\nConcerning this anointing of the sick, we hold it as an\narticle of faith and profess sincerely from the heart that\nsick persons, when they ask it, may lawfully be anointed\n13 J.A. Giles, The Venerable Bede\u2019s Ecclesiastical History of England: Also the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 5th Edition\n(London, Englad: George Bell & Sons, 1887) 57.\n14 John Wesley, The Journal of the Rev. John Wesley, A.M., ed. Nehemiah Curnock (London: Epworth Press,\n1938) I-IX.\n\nwith the anointing oil by one who joins with them in pray-\ning that it may be efficacious to the healing of the body,\naccording to the design and end and effect mentioned by\nthe apostles; and we profess that such an anointing per-\nformed according to the apostolic design and practice, will\nbe healing and profitable.15\nJ. Count Zinzendorf (A.D. 1700-1760)\nCount Zinzendorf was a bishop of the Moravian movement [United\nBrethren] and a close friend of John Wesley. He was a deeply sincere man\nwith a burden for world evangelization. Zinzendorf said the following con-\ncerning the church he served:\nTo believe against hope is the root of the gift of Miracles, and\nI owe this testimony to our Beloved Church, that Apostolic\npowers are there manifested. We have undeniable proofs\nthereof. In the healing of maladies in themselves incurable,\nsuch as Cancer, Consumption, and when the patient was\nin the agonies of death, all by means of a prayer or word.16\nK. John Wesley (A.D. 1703-1791)\nJohn Wesley was a learned man and an Oxford University graduate. He was\ninstrumental in leading a great revival that saved England from moral and civil\nruin. He is an incredibly respected figure in history, both in the religious and\nsecular realms. He gave credible and undeniable witness of God\u2019s mighty power\nto heal. He also testified to the truth that the day of miracles has not passed.\nThe following excerpts are from John Wesley\u2019s diary:\n15 Johannis Lukawitz Waldensin Confession, 1431, as quoted in Gordon, 65.\n16 A. Bost, History of the United Brethren, I, 17, as quoted in Gordon, 66-67.\n\nMarch 19, 1741: \u201cJudith Williams, who was in grievous\npain of both body and mind. After a short time of prayer,\nwe left her. But her pain was gone\u2026her body so strength-\nened that she immediately rose, and the next day went\nabroad\u201d (II, 437).\nOct. 3, 1756: \u201cMy disorder returned as violent as ever;\nbut I regarded it not while I was performing the service at\nSnowfields in the morning, nor afterwards at Spitalfields;\ntill I went to the Lord\u2019s Table to administer. A thought\ncame into my mind, \u201cWhy do I not apply to God in the\nbeginning rather than the end of an illness?\u2019 I did so, and\nfound immediate relief\u2026\u201d\nSept. 2, 1781: \u201cI believe it my duty to relate here what\nsome will esteem a most notable instance of enthusiasm.\nBe it so or not, I have the plain fact. In an hour after we\nleft Taunton, one of the chaise-horses was on a sudden so\nlame that he could hardly set his foot to the ground. It\nbeing impossible to procure any human help, I knew no\nremedy but prayer. Immediately the lameness was gone,\nand he went just as he did before.\u201d17\nThis brief review of history demonstrates that a great array of witnesses\nhave experienced and testified to the healing power of God. Throughout the\nOld and New Testament, God has shown His desire and ability to heal His\npeople. From the early church fathers throughout every age, God has healed\nthe sick. The Bible, history and innumerable present day miracles bear wit-\nness to this truth: Yahweh Rapha is the \u201cLord that heals.\u201d He is \u201cthe same\nyesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8).\n17 Wesley: II, 437; IV, 188; VI, 334.\n\nVII. Divine Healing and the Atonement\nAs mentioned previously in the study of soteriology, the word \u201catone-\nment\u201d literally means \u201ccovering.\u201d It is an Old Testament word that signi-\nfies the covering the Israelites received when they brought to the priests the\nprescribed offerings for their sins. The blood of Jesus Christ was shed not\nmerely for the covering but the remission of sins (Heb. 10:1-18). Therefore,\nthe word atonement is also used to refer to the entire provision of salvation\nGod made for sinners through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. It is\nthis larger sense that will be addressed in the discussion of divine healing and\nthe atonement.\nTo understand God\u2019s will with regard to healing, it is important to exam-\nine the relationship between divine healing and the atonement. It is clear that\nChrist did heal and is able to heal those who are sick. The question remains:\n\u201cDid Christ make special provision for the healing of the body through His\natoning sacrifice on Calvary\u2019s cross?\u201d A further study of Scripture demonstrates\nthat healing is part of the atonement. Thomas Holdcroft wrote, \u201cHealing is\nnot so much an end in itself; it may rather be seen as the appropriation of one\nmore vital aspect of the total victory of Jesus Christ.\u201d18\nA. The correlation in the Bible between healing and the forgiveness of sins\nThere are other passages in the Old and New Testament that demon-\nstrate a close relationship between healing and forgiveness. The psalmist\nwrote, \u201cBless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: Who\nforgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases\u201d (Ps. 103:2-3). James\nstated, \u201cAnd the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him\nup. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven\u201d (James 5:15). Jesus\nsaid, \u201cHe who believes and is baptized will be saved\u2026And these signs will\nfollow those who believe: In My name\u2026they will lay hands on the sick, and\nthey will recover\u201d (Mark 16:16-18). Notice that the same believing that is\nattached to the promise of salvation is also joined to the promise of healing\n18 Holdcroft, 40.\n\nfor the sick. The promise of salvation is for every age; therefore, the signs that\n\u201cfollow those who believe\u201d are available in every age as well. Forgiveness of\nsins and healing are both available through the atonement of Jesus.\nB. Isaiah 53\nIsaiah 53 is the great atonement chapter of the Old Testament. It teaches\nthat Christ bore our sicknesses and sins on Calvary. Through the eye of\nprophecy, Isaiah described the events that were to take place on Calvary hun-\ndreds of years after he prophesied. Verse four reads: \u201cSurely He has borne our\ngriefs And carried our sorrows\u2026\u201d The word translated \u201cgriefs\u201d is the Hebrew\nkholee, which means \u201csickness.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:5 states: \u201cAnd the Lord will\ntake away from you all sickness [kholee]\u2026\u201d Kholee is translated \u201csickness\u201d\nthroughout the Old Testament (Deut. 28:61; 1 Kings 17:17; 2 Kings 1:2;\n8:8; 2 Chron. 16:12; 21:15). The word translated \u201csorrows\u201d in Isaiah 53:4 is\nthe Hebrew makob, which is translated \u201cpain\u201d in several scriptures (Job 14:22;\n33:19; Jer. 51:8).\nTherefore a literal translation of Isaiah 53:4 is: \u201cSurely he has borne our\nsickness and carried our pain.\u201d Rotherham\u2019s translation reads: \u201cYet surely\nour sicknesses he carried, and as for our pains he bore the burden of them.\u201d\nYoung\u2019s Literal Translation reads: \u201cSurely our sicknesses he hath borne, and\nour pains he hath carried them.\u201d The footnotes of the RSV and NASB also\ngive the words \u201csickness\u201d and \u201cpains\u201d as a possible translation.\nIt is also important to notice the verbs in Isaiah 53:4. The word \u201cborne\u201d\nis the Hebrew verb nasa, and the word \u201ccarried\u201d is the Hebrew sabal. The\nverb nasa means to bear in the sense of suffering punishment for something.\n\u201cIf a person sins\u2026he bears [nasa ] guilt\u201d (Lev. 5:1). Verse twelve of the Isaiah\n53 prophecy states: \u201cAnd He [Christ] was numbered with the transgressors,\nAnd He bore [nasa] the sin of many\u2026\u201d Christ bore the sins of humanity\nvicariously as a substitute for all humans. In the same way, He also vicariously\nbore the sickness of humanity. The verb \u201ccarried\u201d is sabal, which also means\nto bear something as a penalty or discipline: \u201cOur fathers sinned and are no\nmore, But we bear [sabal] their iniquities\u201d (Lam. 5:7). Verse eleven of Isaiah\n53 states, \u201cHe [Christ] shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied\u2026For\n\nHe shall bear [sabal] their iniquities.\u201d Christ bore the iniquities of humans\nvicariously, as a substitute. In the same way, He also bore the pains of humans\n(Isa. 53:4).\nMatthew, through the leading of the Holy Spirit, confirmed this trans-\nlation and interpretation when he quoted Isaiah 53:4: \u201cWhen evening had\ncome, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast\nout the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, that it might be\nfulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: \u2018He Himself took\nour infirmities And bore our sicknesses\u2019\u201d (Matt. 8:16-17).\nIsaiah 53 continues to describe the scene about Calvary in verse five: \u201cBut\nHe was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities;\nThe chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are\nhealed.\u201d The word \u201cstripes\u201d can be literally translated \u201cbruise.\u201d This signifies\nthe entire wounding or bruising of Christ including the stripes that were laid\non His back, the buffeting, the plucking out of His beard, the nails driven\ninto His hands and feet, the crown of thorns placed on His brow and the spear\nthat was thrust into His side. All of Christ\u2019s bodily sufferings were for the pur-\npose of bringing forgiveness and healing to all humans. Peter confirmed this\nin his quote of Isaiah 53:5: \u201c\u2026who Himself bore our sins in His own body\non the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness\u2014by\nwhose stripes you were healed\u201d (1 Pet. 2:24). Peter was referring to physical\nhealing because he used the Greek verb iaomai, which is always associated\nwith physical healing and physical ailments when used in the New Testament.\nC. The Passover and the Lord\u2019s Supper\nThe Passover and the Lord\u2019s Supper both teach that God has made provi-\nsion not only for spiritual deliverance but also for bodily health and strength.\nThe blood of a lamb, which was slain on the night of the first Passover in Egypt,\nwas sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of every Hebrew house. This was\nto ensure the sparing of the firstborn son of every household, who ultimately\nrepresented the entire family. Each family ate the body of the lamb so that they\ncould receive physical nourishment and strength for the journey that was before\n\nthem (Exod. 12:7-8). Paul understood that Christ was the ultimate Passover\nlamb: \u201cFor indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us\u201d (1 Cor. 5:7).\nThe significance of the Passover is carried on for Christians in the obser-\nvance of the Lord\u2019s Supper (the communion service). It is interesting to note\nthat in celebrating the Lord\u2019s Supper, Jesus made a distinction between the\nbread and the cup that signify His body and His blood. It seems He wanted His\nfollowers to realize that there was a difference in the provision made by each.\nAs in the Passover observance, the blood is for the forgiveness of sin and the\nsparing of life, while the body is for the health and strength of the individual.\nPaul seemed to have this great truth in mind when he wrote to the church\nat Corinth (1 Cor. 11:17-30). Paul rebuked the Corinthian church for cele-\nbrating their feast of the Lord\u2019s Supper in an unworthy manner. It seems some\nwere consuming all the food and drink and leaving others with nothing. Paul\nwarned them: \u201cFor he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and\ndrinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord\u2019s body. For this reason\nmany are weak and sick among you, and many sleep\u201d (1 Cor. 11:29-30). Paul\nbelieved that many were weak and sick among the Corinthians because they\nwere \u201cnot discerning the Lord\u2019s body.\u201d The sacrifice of the Lord\u2019s body has\nprovided physical strength and healing for humanity. Although healing is\nprovided in the atoning work of Jesus Christ, believers must still appropriate\nby faith what Christ has made available.\nVIII. Why Jesus Healed the Sick\nTheologians have given many explanations for why Jesus healed the sick\nduring His physical ministry on earth. Some of these explanations are scrip-\ntural, while others are more philosophical. Certain explanations have scrip-\ntural validity, while other explanations are based on human reasoning. Some\nphilosophical reasons have been promoted to erroneously argue against God\ncontinuing to heal after the formation of the New Testament. The follow-\ning section will look at two philosophic reasons and six biblical explanations\ngiven for why Jesus healed the sick.\n\nA. Jesus healed the sick to demonstrate His power\nSome believe Jesus performed miraculous healings primarily to demon-\nstrate His power. Although Jesus\u2019 miracles were powerful, He did not go\naround performing miracles just to show that He was able. In fact, Jesus did\nnot do miracles to show His power but to honor the will of the Father. Jesus\nhad all power in heaven and on earth, but He only performed miracles in\nresponse to the Father\u2019s leading. Certainly there was a purpose behind each\nmiracle far more important than the mere show of power.\nB. Jesus healed to initiate the preaching of the gospel\nSome argue that Jesus healed mainly as a way to initiate the preaching of\nthe gospel. These individuals believe the miracles of Jesus were needed only\nto validate the preaching of the gospel until the New Testament was written.\nMany with this view believe that after the New Testament era, miracles were\nno longer needed because Scripture now contains all the truth necessary to\nunderstand and follow God. In other words, this theory suggests that miracles\nhave ceased because they are no longer necessary to reveal God\u2019s purposes\nor validate His gospel. This idea simply has no scriptural support. It is true\nthat performing great miracles did draw multitudes to Jesus. However, it is\nquestionable that Jesus did these mighty works principally to draw crowds or\nsolely to validate His preaching. In fact, on more than one occasion, He com-\nmanded the person He had just healed to tell no one about the miracle (Matt.\n8:4; 12:15-16; Mark 7:36; 8:26; Luke 8:56). On other occasions, Jesus led\nthe needy out of the town, away from the populace, before He healed them\n(Mark 7:33; 8:23). Nowhere in Scripture does it say that it is God\u2019s will for\nmiracles of healing to cease.\nC. Jesus healed to prove His deity\nThere is some scriptural basis that Jesus proved His deity through mira-\ncles of healing. When the scribes questioned Jesus\u2019 ability to forgive sins, He\nsaid to them, \u201cFor which is easier, to say, \u2018Your sins are forgiven you,\u2019 or to say,\n\u2018Arise and walk\u2019? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on\nearth to forgive sins\u2014then He said to the paralytic, \u2018Arise, take up your bed,\n\nand go to your house\u2019\u201d (Matt. 9:5-6). This same basic thought is suggested in\nthe interaction between Jesus and the disciples of John the Baptist:\nAnd when John had heard in prison about the works of\nChrist, he sent two of his disciples and said to Him, \u201cAre\nYou the Coming One, or do we look for another?\u201d Jesus\nanswered and said to them, \u201cGo and tell John the things\nwhich you hear and see: The blind see and the lame walk;\nthe lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are\nraised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them\u201d\n(Matt. 11:2-5).\nThis does not seem to be the most important reason Jesus healed the sick.\nAlthough Jesus healed many, His miracles only convinced a very few that\nHe was their Messiah, the Son of God. Multitudes cried out while He was\nhanging on the cross, \u201cIf He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down\nfrom the cross, and we will believe Him\u2026for He said, \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019\u201d\n(Matt. 27:42-43).\nD. Jesus healed to fulfill the promises of Scripture\n\u201cAnd He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: \u2018He\nHimself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses\u2019\u201d (Matt. 8:16-17).\nE. Jesus healed to reveal His will\nAnd He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there\nwho had a withered hand. So they watched Him closely,\nwhether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they\nmight accuse Him. And He said to the man who had the\nwithered hand, \u201cStep forward\u201d\u2026And when He had looked\naround at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of\ntheir hearts, He said to the man, \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d\nAnd he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole\nas the other (Mark 3:1-5; see also Luke 14:1-6).\n\nF. Jesus healed to manifest the works of God\n\u201cJesus answered, \u2018Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the\nworks of God should be revealed in him\u2019\u201d (John 9:3). Before raising Lazarus\nfrom the dead, Jesus said, \u201cThis sickness is not unto death, but for the glory\nof God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it\u201d (John 11:4).\nG. Jesus healed because of His compassion\nOn at least six occasions the Bible records that Jesus healed because He\nhad compassion on those who were afflicted. This was true of vast multitudes\n(Matt. 9:35-36; 14:14), two blind men (Matt. 20:34), a leper (Mark 1:41),\nthe maniac of Gadara (Mark 5:19) and the widow of Nain whose son Jesus\nraised from the dead (Luke 7:13). F.F. Bosworth pointed out the following\nconcerning the compassion of Jesus:\nModern theology magnifies the power of God more than\nit magnifies His compassion\u2026But the Bible reverses this,\nand magnifies His willingness to use His power more than\nit does the power itself. In no place does the Bible say that\n\u201cGod is power,\u201d but it does say, that \u201cGod is love.\u201d It is not\nfaith in God\u2019s power that secures His blessings, but faith in\nHis love and in His will.19\nIt is not what God can do, but what we know He yearns to\ndo, that inspires faith.20\nHundreds needing healing have come or written to us,\nsaying, concerning their need of deliverance, \u201cthe Lord is\nable;\u201d but their teaching, as well as their lack of teaching,\nhave kept them from knowing that the Lord is willing.\nHow much faith does it take to say \u201cthe Lord is able?\u201d The\n19 Bosworth, 63-64.\n20 Bosworth, 62.\n\ndevil knows God is able, and he knows He is willing; but\nhe has kept the people from knowing this latter fact.21\nH. Jesus healed because of the faith of individuals in His ability and willing-\nness to heal\n1. The faith of others on behalf of the sick\na) The centurion with faith for his servant\u2019s healing (Matt. 8:5-13):\n\u201cLord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak\na word, and my servant will be healed\u201d (v. 8).\nb) The nobleman with faith for his son\u2019s healing (John 4:46-53): \u201cSo the\nman believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. And as\nhe was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, \u2018Your\nson lives!\u2019\u201d (vv. 50-51).\nc) The four men with faith for the paralytic\u2019s healing (Mark 2:1-12):\n\u201cWhen Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, \u2018Son, your sins are for-\ngiven you\u2019\u201d (v. 5).\nd) The Syrophoenician woman with faith for her daughter\u2019s healing\n(Matt. 15:21-28): \u201cThen Jesus answered and said to her, \u2018O woman, great is\nyour faith! Let it be to you as you desire.\u2019 And her daughter was healed from\nthat very hour\u201d (v. 28).\nThey are many additional cases of individuals having faith for the heal-\ning of others (Matt. 9:32-33; 12:22-23; Mark 5:35-43; 7:32; 8:22-26; John\n5:1-15).\n21 Bosworth, 64.\n\n2. The faith of individuals who needed their own healing\na) Woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25-34): \u201cWhen she heard\nabout Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment\u201d\n(v. 27). In response to her faith Jesus said, \u201c\u2026Daughter, your faith has made\nyou well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction\u201d (v. 34). It is interesting\nto note that this woman had no Scripture to guide her to seek healing from\nJesus. The idea started within her own heart. The healing came in response to\nher own faith that Jesus would heal her.\nb) Two blind men (Matt. 9:27-31): \u201cAnd Jesus said to them, \u2018Do you\nbelieve that I am able to do this?\u2019 They said to Him, \u2018Yes, Lord.\u2019 Then He\ntouched their eyes, saying, \u2018According to your faith let it be to you\u2019\u201d (vv. 28-29).\nc) Leprous man (Matt. 8:2-4)\nd) Ten lepers (Luke 17:11-19)\nI. Jesus healed for a combination of reasons\nIn two instances, Scripture mentions that individuals were healed because\nof the compassion of Jesus and the faith of those seeking healing.\n1. Leprous man (Mark 1:40-45): \u201cNow a leper came to Him, imploring\nHim, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, \u2018If You are willing, You can\nmake me clean.\u2019 Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand\nand touched him, and said to him, \u2018I am willing; be cleansed\u2019\u201d (vv. 40-41).\n2. Two blind men (Matt. 20:29-34): \u201cThen the multitude warned them\nthat they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, \u2018Have\nmercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!\u2019 So Jesus stood still and called them, and\nsaid, \u2018What do you want Me to do for you?\u2019 They said to Him, \u2018Lord, that our\neyes may be opened.\u2019 So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And\nimmediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him\u201d (vv. 31-34).\n\nScripture gives many examples of Jesus healing individuals who had a\ndefinite, positive faith that He would heal them. The Bible also gives many\nexamples of Jesus healing the sick because of His great compassion. There is\nnothing in the Bible to indicate that the compassion of the Lord has lessened\nor that God has ceased to respond to the faith of those who come to Him. In\nsome situations, there is no reason given for why Jesus healed (Matt. 8:14-\n15; 8:28-34; Mark 1:23-27; Luke 7:11-16; 13:10-13). Perhaps these healings\nwere simply the result of the sovereign will of Christ to overcome the work\nof the devil.\nIX. Why Christians Should Seek Divine Healing\nA. God is the healer of His people\nGod has expressly declared that He is the healer of His people. This truth\nshould not be viewed with complacency or indifference. God does not show\npartiality (Acts 10:34). Therefore, all should seek the healing God provides.\nIn fact, all individuals have a solemn responsibility to God to receive all that\nHe has for them. God has declared Himself to be the healer of His people\n(Exod. 15:26; 23:25; Deut. 30:20; Ps. 103:3). Consequently, believers should\ntrust God first and foremost for their healing.\nB. Divine healing brings spiritual blessing\nSatan is the ultimate source of disease and sickness. Sickness is not simply\na physical condition but the reflection of the spiritual condition of humanity.\nSatan caused sin, and sin caused sickness. Therefore, individuals should seek\na means of deliverance that not only deals with the physical manifestation of\nsickness but also the spiritual realities associated with sickness.\nWhenever a Christian receives healing as a result of God\u2019s supernatural\ntouch, there is always a glorious spiritual blessing that accompanies the heal-\ning. James wrote that when praying for the sick: \u201c\u2026the prayer of faith will\nsave the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins,\nhe will be forgiven\u201d (James 5:15). In other words, every divine healing also\n\nincludes a positive spiritual result. If the goal of individuals is simply to get\nwell, they will pursue whatever brings them health. However, if their goal is\nto gain a deeper spiritual blessing along with their healing, then they will seek\nthe healing touch of God. Divine healing produces both physical health and\nspiritual victory.\nC. Divine healing brings glory to God\nScripture repeatedly demonstrates that divine healing brings glory to\nGod. The following are some examples: the restoration of the paralyzed man\nlet down through the roof (Matt. 9:8), the healing of the multitudes (Matt.\n15:31), the raising of the widow\u2019s dead son at Nain (Luke 7:16), the deliver-\nance of the woman bowed over for eighteen years (Luke 13:13) and the heal-\ning of the grateful leprous man (Luke 17:15-16). In regard to the sickness of\nLazarus, Jesus said, \u201cThis sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God,\nthat the Son of God may be glorified through it\u201d (John 11:4). The people\ngave glory to God after Lazarus was raised from the dead: \u201cThen many of the\nJews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in\nHim\u201d (John 11:45). God is glorified in divine healing. The service of believers\nbecomes richer and their testimony becomes clearer when they have experi-\nenced the touch of God upon their bodies. Healing magnifies and lifts up the\nname of Jesus.\nX. Methods of Administering Divine Healing\nGod works in a variety of ways. His methods should not be stereotyped\nor oversimplified. This is true in the methods God uses to administer divine\nhealing. The following are six different ways people receive healing from\nthe Lord.\nA. Pray for oneself\nJames wrote the following instructions: \u201cIs anyone among you suffering?\nLet him pray\u201d (James 5:13). Therefore, it is scriptural for individuals to pray\nfor themselves when they are sick.\n\nB. Pray for another\nJames also told believers to \u201c\u2026pray for one another, that you may be\nhealed\u201d (James 5:16). Every Christian can and should pray for the healing of\nothers. There is no ministerial credential or special gift of the Spirit needed\nto pray for the sick.\nC. Call for the elders of the church\nSome refer to James 5:14-16 as the New Testament healing covenant:\nIs anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of\nthe church, and let them pray over him, anointing him\nwith oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith\nwill save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he\nhas committed sins, he will be forgiven. Confess your tres-\npasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you\nmay be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous\nman avails much.\nThis should be the regular procedure for those in fellowship with a local\nchurch. The promise stipulates, \u201cIs anyone among you sick?\u201d Therefore, the\npromise is for everyone: \u201c\u2026the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord\nwill raise him up\u201d (v. 15). In this instance, \u201cthe prayer of faith\u201d is the prayer\noffered by the elders. There is a responsibility resting upon the elders of the\nchurch to pray for the sick. The sick exercise their faith when they call for the\nelders. The elders exercise their faith when they pray for the sick to be healed.\nThe text does not say that the oil will heal the sick; rather, \u201cthe prayer of\nfaith will save the sick.\u201d The oil is a symbol of the anointing of the Holy Spirit\nwho gives life to the mortal bodies of believers (Rom. 8:11). Some associate\nthe oil as the means of healing with Hezekiah\u2019s poultice of figs (2 Kings 20:7).\nIt is not the oil that brings healing but the power of God.\n\nD. Laying on of hands\n\u201cAnd these signs will follow those who believe: In My name\u2026they will\nlay hands on the sick, and they will recover\u201d (Mark 16:17-18). This pas-\nsage does not mention anointing with oil or praying for the sick. It simply\nstates that in the name of Jesus \u201cthey will lay hands on the sick and they will\nrecover.\u201d On a number of occasions, the Scripture describes Jesus healing the\nsick through touching or laying His hand or hands upon them (Matt. 8:15;\nMark 6:5; 8:23-25; Luke 4:40; 5:13; 13:13). When believers lay their hands\non the sick, in the name of Jesus, it is as though they are touching the sick\nwith the hands of Jesus.\nE. Special miracles through handkerchiefs and aprons\n\u201cNow God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even\nhandkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the dis-\neases left them and the evil spirits went out of them\u201d (Acts 19:11-12). These\nwere \u201cspecial miracles\u201d because there were no scriptural instructions concern-\ning this method of healing; instead, Paul must have been guided by the Holy\nSpirit in this matter. Some churches have followed a similar pattern of hand-\ning the sick small pieces of cloth, sometimes anointed with oil. Although\nmiracles have been reported using this method, it is important to realize that\na \u201cprayer cloth\u201d has no healing power in and of itself. Instead, the cloth pro-\nvides opportunity for individuals to express their faith in God\u2019s power to heal.\nF. Spiritual gifts of healing\n\u201cBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of\nall\u2026to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit\u201d (1 Cor. 12:7-9; see also 1\nCor. 12:28). This subject will not be dealt with in detail here because it has\nbeen covered previously in \u201cChapter Six: The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\nThere are, however, two interesting issues to note. First, healing is the only\ngift of the Spirit that is listed in the plural. As mentioned previously, this\nsuggests there are either many gifts of healing for different diseases or that\neach exercise of healing power is a separate gift. Second, it seems that in the\n\nbook of Acts, many of the recorded cases of healing occurred not because the\napostles prayed for healing but because God had anointed them with power\nto heal. These expressions of healing were probably \u201cgifts of healing.\u201d\nXI. Why Some Are Not Healed\nIf the Lord is Yahweh Rapha, our never changing physician; if healing is\nprovided in the atonement of Jesus Christ; if sickness is the work of the devil,\nand Jesus destroyed the work of the devil at the cross; if God is all-powerful\nand full of compassion, then why are not all who are prayed for instantly\nhealed of their diseases? When addressing this question, we should not place\nunmerited blame upon those who are earnestly seeking healing. Human\nknowledge is limited in comparison to the perspective of God. Even though\nwe may not always know why people are sick or remain sick, we can still have\nconfidence that the work of God will be revealed in each person through\nprayer. There are other times when clear hindrances prevent individuals from\nexperiencing the healing of God. The following are some reasons individuals\nare not healed.\nA. Lack of knowledge\nSome are not healed because they do not know that God still heals, or\nthey lack the biblical knowledge of how to seek, ask for and receive healing.\nMany individuals have never seen or experienced a physical healing, while\nothers have been taught against praying for healing. Consequently, there are\nmany individuals who need to be taught through Scripture and testimony\nthat Jesus Christ still heals. During His earthly ministry, Jesus told His disci-\nples to go before Him into every city and \u201c\u2026heal the sick there, and say to\nthem, \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you\u2019\u201d (Luke 10:9). The disci-\nples announced, through their presence and the presence of healings, that the\nkingdom of God was at hand. In preaching the kingdom of God, believers\nmust both announce and demonstrate that God is present to heal. Without\nthis knowledge of God\u2019s healing power, many may not seek His healing grace.\n\nB. Lack of repentance or unconfessed sin\nHealing is not a reward for personal holiness. Like all other blessings\npurchased at the cross, healing comes by the grace of God. However, when\nbelievers refuse to confess and repent of their sins, this hinders their faith\nand ability to receive what the Lord has provided. The psalmist wrote, \u201cIf\nI regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear\u201d (Ps. 66:18). When\nbelievers confess their sins, they are surrendering their lives to the full work of\nthe cross, welcoming both spiritual and physical restoration. This is why the\nScripture admonishes believers to \u201cConfess your trespasses to one another,\nand pray for one another, that you may be healed\u201d (James 5:16).\nC. Issues of faith\n1. Lack of faith\nThroughout His earthly ministry, Jesus repeatedly pointed to the faith\nof those seeking healing as a key reason He answered their requests for heal-\ning (Matt. 8:10; 9:2, 22, 29; 15:28; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:9;\n8:48; 18:42). For instance, \u201c\u2026a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve\nyears came from behind and touched the hem of His garment\u2026Jesus turned\naround, and when He saw her He said, \u2018Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith\nhas made you well.\u2019 And the woman was made well from that hour\u201d (Matt.\n8:20-22; see also Mark 5:25-34; Luke 8:43-48). When ministering in Lystra,\nPaul observed a man who from birth had been unable to stand but \u201chad faith\nto be healed.\u201d Paul \u201c\u2026said with a loud voice, \u2018Stand up straight on your feet!\u2019\nAnd he leaped and walked\u201d (Acts 14:8-10). In the earthly healing ministry of\nJesus and the healing ministry of the early church, faith was essential. Jesus\ncommissioned His disciples not only to \u201cGo into all the world and preach\nthe gospel\u2026\u201d but to \u201clay hands on the sick\u201d expecting that \u201cthey will recover\u201d\n(Mark 16:15-18). James instructed the sick to be prayed for with the assurance\nthat \u201c\u2026the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up\u201d\n(James 5:15). Faith plays a crucial role in the ministry of healing.\n\n2. Misguided faith\nHealing comes from Jesus, not humans or spiritual techniques. While\nit is true that God uses humans to bring about His marvelous works, it is\nimportant that individuals seeking healing look beyond human instruments\nto the source of healing. Sometimes individuals are not healed because they\nseek healing through faith in an individual or a technique instead of Jesus.\nJesus alone is the great physician. When a lame man at the temple gate asked\nfor alms, Peter told the man to \u201cLook at us\u201d to momentarily get the man\u2019s\nattention (Acts 3:4). However, once Peter had the lame man\u2019s attention, he\nimmediately directed him to Jesus: \u201cSilver and gold I do not have, but what I\ndo have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk\u201d\n(Acts 3:6). Healing is rooted in a faith encounter with Jesus.\n3. Powerless faith\nSome miracles require different amounts of faith or power. The Scripture\ntells the story of an epileptic boy whom the disciples \u201ccould not cure\u201d (Matt.\n17:14-16). Jesus rebuked those gathered for being \u201cfaithless\u201d and cured the\nboy by casting a demon out from him (v. 17-18). When the disciples asked\nwhy they could not cast out the demon, Jesus answered, \u201cBecause of your\nunbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you\nwill say to this mountain, \u2018Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move; and\nnothing will be impossible for you. However, this kind does not go out except\nby prayer and fasting\u201d (v. 19-21). Jesus\u2019 words and actions demonstrated that\nsome miracles require more power. Therefore, those who minister or seek\ndivine healing must spend time in spiritual preparation for empowerment.\nD. God\u2019s timing\nSometimes individuals are not immediately healed because of God\u2019s tim-\ning. The story of Zacharias and Elizabeth demonstrates the beauty and mys-\ntery of waiting on God\u2019s timing. Scripture states that the priest, Zacharias,\nand his wife, Elizabeth \u201c\u2026were both righteous before God, walking in all\nthe commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. But they had no\nchild, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in\n\nyears\u201d (Luke 1:6-7). While Zacharias was serving in the temple of the Lord,\nan angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, \u201cDo not be afraid, Zacharias,\nfor your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you\nshall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will\nrejoice at his birth\u201d (Luke 1:13-14). Zacharias and Elizabeth had prayed and\nwaited most of their lives for Elizabeth\u2019s womb to be healed. God waited to\nanswer their prayers at just the right moment. Consequently, many rejoiced\nat the birth of their son John, a child who would eventually \u201cmake ready a\npeople prepared for the Lord\u201d (Luke 1:17).\nAlthough healing is important, it is not the most important experi-\nence that can happen in a person\u2019s life. Salvation, spiritual growth and the\nadvancement of the kingdom of God are far more important than an indi-\nvidual simply experiencing physical health. Therefore, there are undoubtedly\ntimes when God gives spiritual purposes precedence over physical blessings.\nSometimes individuals must persevere in contending for their healing as they\ntrust in God\u2019s perfect will and timing, knowing that perseverance brings the\ncharacter of God as well as a hope that \u201cdoes not disappoint\u201d (Rom. 5:4).\nE. To demonstrate God\u2019s power and strength\nThe Scripture demonstrates that sometimes individuals living with sick-\nness or infirmity reveal the power and strength of God through living by\nfaith in the sufficiency of His grace. Paul mentioned that he pleaded with\nGod three times to remove a \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d that had caused him great\nweakness. However, God responded, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for My\nstrength is made perfect in weakness\u201d (2 Cor. 12:9). Scholars disagree as to\nwhether or not Paul\u2019s thorn in the flesh was sickness. Regardless, he makes\ndirect mention in the next verse that God reveals His strength through those\nwho persevere in the midst of infirmities: \u201cTherefore most gladly I will rather\nboast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore\nI take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in dis-\ntresses, for Christ\u2019s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong\u201d (v. 9-10).\nThrough faith, the strength of God is made evident in the midst of sickness.\n\nThe story of Epaphroditus also demonstrates that individuals reveal the\nstrength and power of God through walking by faith in their sickness. Paul\nmentioned that Epaphroditus was a fellow brother, worker and soldier in the\nfaith who \u201cwas sick almost unto death\u201d because in doing \u201cthe work of Christ\nhe came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking\nin your service toward me\u201d (Phil. 2:25-29). Paul pointed out that men like\nEpaphroditus should be esteemed for their faithfulness and willingness to\nserve God even at the cost of their own health. Epaphroditus\u2019 body suffered\nas a result of his ministry assignment. The human body will face sickness as\na result of living in a fallen world. Even so, Christians can have confidence\nthat God\u2019s power and strength will be made evident through every believer\nwho lives by faith.\nF. God\u2019s sovereignty\nThe psalmist wrote in praise to God that \u201cMy times are in Your hand\u2026\u201d\n(Ps. 31:15). Job, in the midst of anguish, lamented to God that for man\n\u201cSince his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; You\nhave appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass\u201d (Job 14:5). Both verses\npoint to the limits of human understanding in the light of God\u2019s wisdom, will\nand sovereignty. In other words, there are aspects about our lives that God\nunderstands, but we do not understand or fully know. Regardless, we trust\nthat God is good and in control.\nUltimately, until Christ\u2019s return, each human will face death. Every human\nis born into a fallen world and into a corruptible, perishable body. Although\nevery human in Christ is a new creation, our bodies are still perishable and\ncorruptible. Therefore, \u201c\u2026this corruptible must put on incorruption, and\nthis mortal must put on immortality\u201d (1 Cor. 15:53). This transformation\nwill occur \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For\nthe trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we\nshall be changed\u201d (v. 52). It will be at that moment, \u201c\u2026when this corruptible\nhas put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall\nbe brought to pass the saying that is written: \u2018Death is swallowed up in vic-\ntory\u2019\u201d (v. 54). Although death has been defeated at the cross, it will ultimately\n\ndisappear with the resurrection of our bodies. Until then, all humans will face\nsome manner of sickness that leads to death.\nEvery believer should seek the healing power of God. God has demon-\nstrated His healing power throughout the Bible and the history of the church.\nHis desire and ability to heal is present today. All believers should actively\nexercise the faith God has given them to seek and receive the healing power\nof Jesus. However, it is important to remember that human understanding is\nlimited in comparison to the vast and infinite wisdom of God. Consequently,\nthere are times when we cannot fully understand or comprehend why some-\none remains sick or is not healed. Despite our comprehension, we can have\nconfidence that the character of Christ and the good news of the kingdom of\nGod will be revealed through every believer who continues to live for God by\nfaith. Sometimes, we simply do not know why people are not healed. In these\nmoments, we trust the goodness and the sovereignty of God. We also trust\nthe power of the cross, that although our bodies may face death, in Christ we\nare forever alive.\nXII. How to Respond to Divine Healing\nNumerous individuals have personally experienced the healing touch of\nthe Lord Jesus. Many who have been healed have dedicated their lives to hon-\noring, worshiping, serving and proclaiming Jesus. Others have experienced\nhealing from God but still refused to serve and live for their healer. In some\ncases, individuals healed from diseases or sicknesses specifically caused by sin-\nful behaviors have continued to engage in those sinful behaviors after being\nhealed. Sometimes this has led to the sickness returning. Whenever individ-\nuals are healed by God, it is always for a higher spiritual purpose than just\nphysical restoration. Therefore, it is important to prayerfully consider how\nbest to respond to any instance of divine healing. The following are positive\nways to respond to divine healing.\n\nA. Stop willfully sinning\nIndividuals who have received the healing touch of Jesus should genu-\ninely desire to stop willfully sinning. When people repent of and turn away\nfrom their sins, they are acknowledging that God has healed them not only\nfor health but for spiritual growth and intimacy with God. Soon after healing\na man at the Pool of Bethesda, Jesus found him at the Temple and said to\nhim, \u201cSee, you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come\nupon you\u201d (John 5:14). Apparently, sin played a role in the man\u2019s affliction,\nand Jesus warned that unrepentant sin would lead to something worse. This\ncertainly does not mean that Christians must live perfect lives to enjoy the\nblessings or healing of God. It does, however, mean that individuals are not\nhealed by God to live unrepentant lives.\nB. Strengthen your faith\nHealing is received by faith. Those who are healed should continue\nto grow in faith. Ultimately, individuals who receive healing should also\nprayerfully develop an unwavering faith that allows them to stand against\ntheir \u201c\u2026adversary the devil\u2026\u201d and \u201cResist him, steadfast in the faith\u2026\u201d (1\nPet. 5:8-9). One of Satan\u2019s chief occupations is to rob people of their faith:\n\u201c\u2026then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they\nshould believe and be saved\u201d (Luke 8:12). Therefore, it is crucial for anyone\nwho has experienced the healing touch of God to engage in activities and\nrelationships that strengthen their faith. This means participating in a healthy\nchurch where individuals can be strengthened by worship, the study of the\nWord and godly fellowship.\nC. Praise the Lord for what He has done\nHealing is a grace gift from God. It is not earned or merited. No one has\never deserved the healing they have received. Therefore, when an individual\nis healed, they should give all glory, gratitude and honor to God. The Bible\ngives us this example in the story of Jesus healing ten lepers (Luke 17:11-19).\nAfter entering a village, Jesus met ten lepers who pleaded for His mercy. Jesus\ntold them to \u201cGo, show yourselves to the priests\u201d and on their journey \u201cthey\n\nwere cleansed.\u201d Even though ten where healed, only one Samaritan came\nback to give glory to God. Jesus responded by saying, \u201c\u2018Were there not ten\ncleansed? But where are the nine? Were there not any found who returned\nto give glory to God except this foreigner?\u2019 And He said to him, \u2018Arise, go\nyour way. Your faith has made you well\u2019\u201d (Luke 17:17-19). When individuals\nexperience the healing touch of God, it is right to praise and glorify God for\nwhat He has done.\nD. Testify of what God has done\nWhen God heals individuals, it is right for them to testify of God\u2019s good-\nness and grace, especially since healing is not just for the physical body but\nfor spiritual transformation as well. When individuals are healed, they should\ntell others of God\u2019s gracious goodness to them. Of course, this must be done\nwith a real sense of humility, understanding that individuals do not receive\nhealing because they are somehow better than others.\nSometimes when individuals are healed, they are reluctant to testify of\ntheir healing because they fear they are not fully well, or their sickness may\nreturn, and their testimony will become invalid. It is important that healed\nindividuals do not live in fear but are free to testify of God\u2019s healing provision.\nWhen the devil brings accusation against a newly healed person that he or she\nis not healed or should fear becoming sick again, the healed individual must\nrealize that the devil is a liar: \u201cWhen he [the devil] speaks a lie, he speaks from\nhis own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it\u201d (John 8:44). Instead\nof living in fear or doubt, those who have been genuinely healed are free to\nboldly and confidently proclaim and celebrate that God has healed them.\nSince healing is a grace gift from God, they should not hesitate to take a firm\nstand on celebrating God\u2019s unfailing provision.\nE. Study God\u2019s word\nAlthough God often uses the prayer of individuals to bring about heal-\ning, it is important to remember that any minister of healing is helpless apart\nfrom the Lord Jesus Christ. God does the work of healing. When individuals\nare healed, they should be first and foremost drawn to Jesus. Consequently,\n\nhealing should lead to a greater love, appreciation and study of the Scripture:\n\u201cSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d (Rom.\n10:17). When individuals study the Bible, they become grounded in their\nfaith and confident in their healing. For those who\u2019ve been healed, it is good\nto meditate upon the healing promises of Scripture such as \u201cI am the LORD\nwho heals you\u201d (Exod. 15:26). Through studying the Word, the newly healed\ncan have confidence that Jesus \u201c\u2026Himself took our infirmities And bore our\nsicknesses\u201d (Matt. 8:17) giving us assurance that by His \u201cstripes\u201d we \u201cwere\nhealed\u201d (1 Pet. 2:24).\nF. Follow God\u2019s word\nJust as we are saved to serve and obey the Lord, we are also healed to\nserve and obey the Lord. God\u2019s will is revealed in hearing and obeying His\nword. Healing is a gift from God that should not be wasted on selfish pur-\nsuits. Instead, individuals who have been healed should use their health and\nstrength to do God\u2019s will. This means healed individuals should find places of\nministry within God\u2019s church to faithfully serve with their time, money and\nenergy. This means faithfully tithing and working diligently in a local body of\nbelievers. It requires bringing others to the Lord. There are multitudes who\nneed God\u2019s saving and healing power. God has healed and imparted life to us\nso that we can bring that same life to others. Ultimately, every healed believer\nhas been called to live wholly for God and to enjoy the fullness of what God\nhas done in healthy Christian community.\nXIII. Divine Life for the Body\nWhen we reach out in faith to claim all of the promises of God, we more\nclearly see that Christ Jesus has provided a complete salvation that embraces\nthe entire human: spirit, soul and body. \u201cFor in Him [Christ] dwells all the\nfullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him\u2026\u201d (Col. 2:9-\n10). Jesus proclaimed that, \u201cI have come that they may have life, and that they\nmay have it more abundantly\u201d (John 10:10). The life that Jesus has provided\nincludes His life for our physical bodies. Aimee Semple McPherson once\nwrote: \u201cDivine healing\u2026is not performing a ceremony, it is not wringing a\n\npetition from the heavens by the logic of faith and the force of your will, but\nit is the inbreathing of the life of God. It is the living touch which none can\nunderstand except those whose senses are exercised to know the realities of\nthe world unseen.\u201d1\nDivine healing is the divine life of the Holy Spirit working in the physical\nbody: \u201cBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,\nHe who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bod-\nies through His Spirit who dwells in you\u201d (Rom. 8:11). Divine healing and\nhealth is part of that life which is \u201cin Christ.\u201d Paul testified to Christ\u2019s life in\nhim when he wrote, \u201cI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who\nlive, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by\nfaith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\u201d (Gal. 2:20).\nMoses testified to this experience when he called the children of Israel to \u201c\u2026\nlove the Lord your God, that you may obey His voice, and that you may cling\nto Him, for He is your life and the length of your days\u2026\u201d (Deut. 30:20).\nIn his letters to the New Testament church, Paul explicitly and frequently\nwrote about the life of Christ in the mortal body. In speaking of trials and\nhardships Paul wrote that he was \u201calways carrying about in the body the\ndying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our\nbody. For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus\u2019 sake, that the\nlife of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh\u201d (2 Cor. 4:10-11).\nPaul was speaking about more than just spiritual life in our unseen spirit;\nhe was also addressing the life of Jesus in our physical or mortal bodies. In\nother words, our mortal bodies are benefited through our blessed identifica-\ntion with Christ. Paul was addressing more than just a new kind of living,\nbut an actual new life for every believer: \u201cFor we are members of His body,\nof His flesh and of His bones\u201d (Eph. 5:30). To the Corinthians, Paul wrote,\n\u201cDo you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?\u201d (1 Cor. 6:15).\nIt is Christ\u2019s life that flows through, strengthens and heals our mortal bodies:\n\u201cFor this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026that\nHe would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened\nwith might through His Spirit in the inner man\u2026filled with all the fullness\n1 Aimee Semple McPherson, from the author\u2019s notes.\n\nof God\u201d (Eph. 3:14-19). Biblically-based faith will not limit the blessings of\nGod to spiritual needs alone. Kenneth MacKenzie described the relationship\nbetween the divine life and the body:\nDivine Healing is just Divine Life. It is the union of our\nmembers with the very body of Christ, and the inflowing\nlife of Christ in our living members. It is as real as His\nrisen and glorified body.\nIt is as reasonable as the fact that He was raised from the\ndead, and is a living man with a true body and a rational\nsoul today at God\u2019s right hand. That living Christ belongs\nto us in all His attributes and power. We are members\nof His body, of His flesh, and His bones; and if we can\nonly believe it, we may live upon the very life of the Son\nof God.2\nNo longer are we in bondage to the old sentiment that\nthe body is a miserable tenement in which we endure our\nconfinement until at last we are released. But it becomes\nthe scene of the sanctifying inworking of the Holy Spirit,\nwhich, pressing into every niche of our being, permeates\nthe whole with His Holy energy, and insures the posses-\nsion and experience of Christ\u2019s very life.3\nXIV. Objections to Divine Healing\nThroughout this divine healing chapter, most of the objections to the\ndoctrine of divine healing have been anticipated and answered in substance.\nHowever, because there is still some strong opposition to the doctrine of\ndivine healing among certain Christians, the following section will answer\n2 Mackenzie, 56-57.\n3 Mackenzie, 59-60.\n\nsome of the most common objections to modern day divine healing. It is\nnot that these objections are formidable, but that individuals should be ready\nand able to give clear answers to every major objection without hesitation or\nconfusion. Ultimately, when Christians learn how to answer these objections,\nthey are more willing to both minister and receive the gift of divine heal-\ning. The following are common objections Christians have concerning mod-\nern-day, divine healing and clear, biblically-based answers to those objections.\nA. The objection that miracles are not rational\nSome rationalist Christians believe that miracles, such as healing, will not\ntake place because God has always limited His works to the natural laws of\nthe universe. The problem with this argument is it discounts the miraculous\ncreation of the universe as well as the miraculous foundations of the Christian\nfaith. The creation of the universe, the formation of humans and the natural\nlaws of the universe are miraculous expressions of God\u2019s creative, life-giving\npower. It is not beyond reason or rationale that the Omnipotent Creator of all\nlife, who spoke life into existence, is also able and willing to presently bring\nmiraculous life to those seeking healing.\nJust as the creation of the universe is rooted in the miraculous power of\nGod, so is the foundation of the Christian faith rooted in the miraculous\nincarnation, resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. The life of Jesus is\na supernatural expression that makes room for the possibility of miracles in\na supposedly natural world. The historical response to the life, resurrection\nand ascension of Jesus disproves the rationalist\u2019s argument against miracles.\nAlthough there was seemingly no earthly benefit to testifying to the resurrec-\ntion of Jesus, the disciples and New Testament writers proclaimed this truth\nat the cost of their own lives and the safety of their friends and families. The\nmiracle of Christ\u2019s resurrection and the miracle of creation itself demonstrate\nthat God moves beyond and above the laws of nature. If Jesus rose from the\ndead, it is also possible for that same miraculous power to heal the bodies of\nGod\u2019s children today (Rom. 8:11).\n\nB. The objection that miracles have ceased\nSome Christians believe miracles, including divine healing, have ceased.\nThese individuals believe miracles were confined to an age or dispensation of\nmiracles that eventually ended once God had accomplished specific purposes.\nThey contend that healing was only a sign permitted in the first century\nto attest to the supernatural character of Christianity. However, they believe\nhealings ceased once the truths of Christianity were confirmed and the Bible\nwas completed. While some of His miracles were used as signs, Jesus healed\nnot only as a sign but because He had compassion upon the people in their\npainful state (Mark 1:41; Matt. 9:35-38; 14:14; 20:34). Jesus is just as com-\npassionate today and still willing to act upon that compassion when indi-\nviduals seek His healing touch. Furthermore, it would seem that every new\ncentury, even every generation, would also need miraculous signs and con-\nfirmations to demonstrate the validity of Christianity\u2019s supernatural origins.\nMore importantly, nowhere in Scripture does it speak of miracles ceasing.\nOn the contrary, the Bible represents God as being eternally the same (Mal.\n3:6; Heb. 13:8; James 1:17; Ps. 102:27). The author of Acts mentions that in\nthe gospel of Luke he gave an account of what \u201c\u2026Jesus began both to do and\nteach, until the day in which He was taken up\u2026\u201d (Acts 1:1-2). This implies\nthat the miraculous work of Jesus had just begun and certainly not ended at\nHis ascension (see also Mark 16:17). In fact, Acts is a record of the miraculous\nwork of Jesus carried out and continued through the Holy-Spirit-empowered\nchurch. The Acts narrative shows an increasing of the miraculous within the\nchurch, fulfilling what Jesus had promised: \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, he\nwho believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works\nthan these he will do, because I go to My Father\u201d (John 14:12). As mentioned\npreviously in this chapter, church history is full of testimonies concerning the\nnever ceasing, miraculous healing provision of God. If miracles have actually\nceased, then it is important to realize that the possibility of conversion no\nlonger exists because conversion is as miraculous and supernatural as divine\nhealing. The simple truth is every age is an age of miracles for those who have\nfaith in God. For faith says, \u201cAll things are possible\u201d (Matt. 19:26).\n\nC. The objection that medical science has replaced the need for divine healing\nSome suggest that Jesus healed during Bible times because there was no\ncompetent medical science. Now that the field of medicine has advanced, they\nargue that individuals should use medicine for healing rather than prayer. In\nresponding to this objection, it is important to realize that prayer and med-\nical science are not in competition with each other. Humankind\u2019s ability to\nprevent and cure sicknesses and diseases through medical science is ultimately\nthe fruit of being wonderfully made by God to examine and solve complex\nproblems (James 1:17). However, even with scientific advancements, there\nare still two, primary reasons people should earnestly seek healing even while\nseeking medical interventions.\n1. Medical science is limited in its ability to cure sicknesses\nScience is currently not able to cure many sicknesses and diseases. Even\nwhen modern science can bring healing, there are often complications and\nside effects due to the medicine or procedures needed to produce that heal-\ning. Although there are many amazing advancements in medicine, rarely\ndo these advancements completely restore individuals to the body they had\nbefore they became sick. For many others, there is simply no medical cure for\ntheir sickness. Their only hope is the healing touch of Jesus.\n2. Divine healing provides both physical and spiritual healing\nDivine healing provides more than just a physical cure; it also provides a\nspiritual blessing. When individuals are healed by God, they are transformed\nboth physically and spiritually. It is more than just the removal of sickness; it\nis ultimately an encounter with the healing presence of God. Even if medical\nscience could cure every sick person on earth, it would not make the need\nfor divine healing unnecessary. When individuals are healed by their loving,\nheavenly Father, their faith is strengthened as a result of being both physically\nand spiritually blessed. Natural sciences are good and will always be needed,\nbut advancements in modern medicine should not prevent the sick from\nseeking the transformative healing that comes through faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nD. The objection that divine healing is only taught by false cults\nSome believe divine healing should not be taught because it is only\npracticed by false cults. This statement is simply not true. As mentioned\npreviously, Wesley, Luther, Zinzendorf and many other respected church\nleaders throughout history taught and practiced divine healing. Healing has\nalways played a crucial role in the history of the church. Even so, Satan has\nfrequently tried to counterfeit God\u2019s true blessings. Consequently, it is no\nsurprise that false cults and false leaders have tried to counterfeit the true\nhealing that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. Although some false cults\nteach a kind of healing, their doctrines of healing are very different than the\northodox, biblical doctrine of divine healing. The presence of false teachings\nand false teachers does not negate the true promise of divine healing revealed\nthroughout Scripture.\nE. The objection that divine healing puts more emphasis on the body than\nthe soul\nSome object to divine healing because they believe it emphasizes the\nphysical above the spiritual. If this objection is to be admitted, then the same\nobjection must be made of the ministry of Jesus and the ministry of His\napostles. As mentioned throughout this chapter, healing played a central role\nin the ministry of Jesus and His apostles. All four gospels and the book of\nActs repeatedly highlight the miraculous healing power of God. For example,\nhealings accompany every revival recorded in the book of Acts (see Acts 8:5-\n8; 9:36-42; 14:6-10; 16:16-18; 19:11-12; 28:7-9).\nThe Lord Jesus and His disciples clearly preached and practiced divine\nhealing without fear of over-emphasizing bodily needs over spiritual needs.\nSalvation for the soul and healing for the body are both part of Christ\u2019s aton-\ning work. Therefore, they should be preached together as aspects of the same\nmessage (Isa. 53:4-5; 1 Pet. 2:24). To omit the healing message is to preach\npart of the good news found in Jesus Christ. It is also important to remember\nthat divine healing is as much spiritual as it is physical. Through divine heal-\ning, individuals realize ever more deeply the nearness and providential care of\n\ntheir personal Savior and Lord; their faith is strengthened and they are made\nprofoundly aware of the great love of God.\nAlthough Christians are called to live by faith in this temporal world,\nhumans have need of God\u2019s material provision and blessing. Just as it is\nappropriate to pray for financial provision, food, clothing, shelter, protection\nand other basic material benefits, it is also appropriate to pray for physical\nwell-being. When individuals pray for material provision or physical health,\nthis does not prevent them from growing spiritually as long as they never seek\nthe miraculous provision of God apart from the fundamental truth of God\nrevealed in Scripture.\nGod is Yahweh Rapha, \u201cthe LORD our Healer\u201d (Exod. 15:26). Jesus\nChrist has demonstrated God\u2019s unchanging nature to heal and restore those\nwho seek Him by faith. Throughout the Bible and throughout church history,\nGod has revealed Himself to be our ever-present healer. In Christ, believers\nhave access to the life-giving, healing power of God. Jesus Christ is \u201c\u2026the\nsame yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8). Therefore, if anyone is sick\nthey should eagerly seek and receive the healing touch of Jesus. Ultimately,\nhealing is a grace gift from God to be received by faith. It is not earned or\nmerited. Although healing is provided as part of the atonement, there is still\nmystery as to why some are healed and others are not. Regardless, we can\ntrust the goodness of God as we earnestly seek His healing provision, being\nconfident with the apostle Paul \u201c\u2026that He who has begun a good work in\nyou will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Phil. 1:6)."};
