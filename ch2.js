John Calvin said, \u201cNearly all the wisdom we possess, that is to say,\ntrue and sound wisdom, consists of two parts; the knowledge of God and of\nourselves.\u201d1 Consequently, to know ourselves we must to some degree know\nGod and His will for our lives.\nTheology is the study of God. The term theology comes from the Greek\nwords theos meaning \u201cGod\u201d and logos meaning \u201cidea, word, speech, discus-\nsion, reason, study.\u201d Through theology we understand and develop the doc-\ntrine of God. Generally speaking, there are three categories of theology:\n(1) Natural Theology\u2014The study of God in the universe and nature\n(2) Biblical Theology\u2014The study of God in the Scripture\n1 John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion (Edinburgh, Scotland: T. & T. Clark, 1845).\n\n(3) Systematic Theology\u2014The systematized study of God using the\nScripture as well as scientific, philosophical and ethical reasoning\nWhile Christian theology is based primarily on the Holy Scripture and\nthe revelation of God through Jesus Christ, His Son, there are also intellec-\ntual and philosophical arguments that help communicate the truth of God.\nConsequently, this book will also employ systematic and formalized ways\nof communicating theology and doctrine. In the context of the Doctrine of\nGod, the term theology will be used to specifically describe the study of God\u2019s\nexistence, nature, names, attributes and works.\nI. The Knowability of God\nA. Greater than human comprehension\nGod is the Infinite One. In one sense, He is incomprehensible. How\ncan finite beings comprehend the infinite, limitless God? How can the cre-\nated fully understand the Creator? Isaiah 55:8-9 declares, \u201c\u2018For My thoughts\nare not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,\u2019 says the LORD. \u2018For\nas the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your\nways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\u2019\u201d The apostle Paul exclaimed,\n\u201cOh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\nHow unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!\u201d (Rom.\n11:33). The fullness of God\u2019s nature, plans and designs far exceed the limits\nof human comprehension.\nB. Knowable\nAlthough God is infinite, He is also profoundly knowable. Through\nJesus, God has clearly revealed Himself to humanity. Paul wrote that Jesus\nis \u201c\u2026the image of the invisible God\u2026\u201d (Col. 1:15). Hebrews refers to Jesus\nas the \u201cbrightness\u201d and \u201cthe express image\u201d of God (Heb. 1:3). In John\u2019s\ngospel Jesus said, \u201c\u2026He who has seen Me has seen the Father\u2026\u201d (John\n14:9). While people unaided cannot come to fully know the infinite God, it\n\nis clear that God has revealed Himself and can be known to the extent of His\nself-revelation. In fact, redemption and eternal life are grounded in knowing\nGod: \u201cAnd this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God,\nand Jesus Christ whom You have sent\u201d (John 17:3). Even so, this knowledge\nis limited until we reach our heavenly home: \u201cFor now we see in a mirror,\ndimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just\nas I also am known\u201d (1 Cor. 13:12). Although God is infinitely greater than\nhuman comprehension, He is still intimately knowable.\nII. The Existence of God\nA. The value of the argument for God\u2019s existence\nSome question the value of formulating arguments for the existence of\nGod. They view a belief in God\u2019s existence to be primarily an issue of faith.\nEven the Scripture seems to dedicate little or no space to arguing for the\npresence of a creator. The Scripture begins with the certainty of God: \u201cIn the\nbeginning God created the heavens and the earth\u201d (Gen. 1:1). For the most\npart, the Bible conveys the existence of God as a reality to be received by faith\nor to be rejected. Even so, this faith does not contradict reason or the natural\nworld. The psalmist sang, \u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God; And the\nfirmament shows His handiwork\u201d (Ps. 19:1). Paul wrote that humans who\nreject God are responsible for their rebellion: \u201cFor since the creation of the\nworld His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things\nthat are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are with-\nout excuse\u2026\u201d (Rom. 1:20). The Scripture supports the validity of a natural\ntheology. However, while natural theology may point to a knowable creator,\nit offers no real solution for the problem of sin (John 1:29). It is important\nto note that limited arguments from finite beings cannot fully communicate\nthe existence of an infinite God. Consequently, the arguments that follow\nare not a substitute for Holy-Spirit-empowered, scriptural revelation. Rather\nthey provide assurance that the natural world confirms, defends and bolsters\nGod\u2019s supernatural revelation.\n\nB. Arguments for God\u2019s existence\n1. The argument from reason: The first phase of the argument from\nreason revolves around the concept of cause and effect. Human existence\ntakes place within the context of matter and motion. The existence of matter\nand motion has three possible explanations: (1) they exist eternally, (2) they\nemerged from nothing or (3) they were caused. It is unlikely the universe\nexists eternally, for all evidence points to a universe whose energy is dissipat-\ning rather than increasing. According to the second law of thermodynam-\nics, the sun and the stars are losing energy at a measurable rate. Radioactive\nmaterials are also losing their radiation. Furthermore, spectrographic studies\nshow all heavenly bodies are travelling outward from the center. This infor-\nmation seems to indicate the sun and stars share a single point of origin and\na decisive beginning. Second, the argument that matter and motion emerged\nfrom nothing is a contradiction. The ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides\nargued, \u201cNothing comes from nothing.\u201d Therefore, the most reasonable\nexplanation is that matter and motion were created at a specific time by an\ninitial cause. Most scientists believe the universe is between five and twenty\nbillion years old. Some propose its beginning occurred through a series of\nemergences or the work of an impersonal creator. Considering the universe\u2019s\ngreat complexity, it is logical to view the universe\u2019s existence as the work of an\nintelligent creator.\nAnother support of the argument from reason is that humans seem to\npossess an innate belief in the existence of a creator. Sociologists and sci-\nentists have repeatedly evidenced humankind\u2019s apparent natural propensity\nto believe in God or gods. All people groups appear to have historical and\ncultural foundations deeply rooted in deity worship and religious practices.\nThis does not mean all people have a fully developed belief in God. However,\nit does seem to indicate that religious belief and the propensity to worship a\ndeity are natural to humanity.\n2. The argument from nature: Almost everything in nature appears to\nhave an intelligent design and purpose. There is astounding balance and\ninterconnectivity in the natural world. For instance, the earth is tilted on\nits axis in relation to the sun, thereby providing the seasons and the best\n\ndistribution of light and heat throughout the year. The earth\u2019s distance from\nthe sun is ideal for avoiding searing heat and freezing cold. The chemical\ncomposition of the atmosphere is perfect for animal and vegetable life. The\nratio of land and water on the earth\u2019s surface provides the proper amount of\nrainfall and humidity. Even the wind and sea currents bring just the right\namount of cooling and warmth to foster and sustain life.\nA study of water also points to a divine design and order within nature.\nWater is one of the most common substances on the earth. While most other\nsubstances become denser with lowered temperature, water expands and\nbecomes less dense when frozen. Ice floats on top of lakes, rivers and seas. If\nwater became denser when frozen, many bodies of water would never thaw,\nmaking the earth\u2019s surface glacial and uninhabitable. Certainly, such a design\nvariance points to a wise creator.\nBeyond the utility of nature, the glorious sights and sounds of the natu-\nral world speak of a creator who designed ears and eyes to experience beauty\nand pleasure. To believe an impersonal force or random process brought such\na remarkable and ordered universe into being seems illogical. As scientific\ndiscovery progresses, the words of the psalmist perpetually ring true, \u201cThe\nheavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork\u201d\n(Ps. 19:1).\n3. The argument from history: The argument from history rests upon\nthe foundation of divine providence. Although God does not cause every\nindividual event, He is in control of the stream of events that ultimately\nbrings to pass His overarching purposes. Throughout history God has ful-\nfilled the prophecies of the Scripture. A discernable pattern, focused upon\nJesus Christ, is divinely woven throughout the Bible as well as human his-\ntory. God\u2019s purpose in Christ is seen in Israel\u2019s documented history as well\nas Israel\u2019s indestructibility throughout the centuries (Gen. 12:13; Isa. 52:10-\n53:12). This purpose is further evidenced through the New Testament in\nChrist\u2019s incarnation, life, death and resurrection as well as in the church\u2019s his-\ntoric triumph over manifold opposition. Many key events in human history\npoint to a superintending God.\n\n4. The argument from the human condition: The distinct character and\nmoral nature of humans point to the existence of a creator. The Word of\nGod declares that humans are uniquely defined as being created in the image\nof God:\nThen God said, \u201cLet Us make man in Our image,\naccording to Our likeness; let them have dominion over\nthe fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the\ncattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing\nthat creeps on the earth.\u201d So God created man in His\nown image; in the image of God He created him; male\nand female He created them (Gen. 1:26-27).\nSince humans are made in God\u2019s likeness, they are uniquely set apart\nfrom all other created things. That uniqueness is expressed in humans having\ndominion over the creatures of the earth as well as capacity for and yearning\nfor fellowship with God. Humans also express God\u2019s likeness in their moral\nnature, sense of duty and the possession of a conscience. Paul wrote that the\nhuman conscience attests to \u201cthe work of the law written in their hearts\u201d\n(Rom. 2:15). C. S. Lewis said:\nThese then are the two points I wanted to make. First,\nthat human beings, all over the earth, have this curious\nidea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and\ncannot really get rid of it. Secondly, they do not in fact\nbehave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they\nbreak it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear\nthinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.2\nThe conflicted conscience of humans points to the fact that a personal\nGod holds people responsible for their conduct and attitude. People were\nmade to commune with God and to yield their God-given capacity to God\u2019s\nwill and authority. When humans refuse to acknowledge their God-ordained\n2 Clive Staples Lewis, Mere Christianity, (New York, Macmillan and Company, 1952) 21. C.S. Lewis\u2019 writ-\nings have been very effective in presenting the Christian message to educated people.\n\ncreated purposes, they live with a guilty conscience. While it is possible to\nsear the human conscience or quiet it by self-deception, every person will\ninevitably try to work out a value system that defends the worth of their life.\nIn trying to defend or justify the moral rightness of their existence, humans\nacknowledge that they have a created purpose for existence.\n5. The argument from Scripture: The argument from Scripture rests\nupon the validity of its claims and upon its accuracy. The Bible claims to be\nthe inspired Word of God (Jer. 1:1-13; 1 Cor. 2:12-13; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2\nPet. 1:20-21). Many have questioned the Bible\u2019s accuracy, but archeological\nfindings have repeatedly confirmed its correctness. The renowned archeol-\nogist Dr. W. F. Albright wrote, \u201cNothing tending to disturb the religious\nfaith of Jew or Christian has been discovered\u2026Discovery after discovery has\nestablished the accuracy of innumerable details, and has brought increased\nrecognition of the value of the Bible as a source book of history.\u201d3 No other\nbook compares with the Bible for elevated moral and spiritual teaching. It\nnever ceases to speak with power and healing to the deepest problems of the\nhuman soul and spirit.\nC. Erroneous theories about God\nThe Bible teaches that God is the all-powerful, all-wise creator of every-\nthing. He is just and holy while still loving and merciful. He is transcendent\n(above and distinct from the creation) yet also immanent (resident in and\ninvolved with his creation). He is a personal God who seeks fellowship with\nHis redeemed people. He punishes ultimate rebellion with eternal death. He\nrewards faith with eternal life through His Son and Mediator, Jesus Christ.\nHe is the Supreme Being; Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He spoke into being\nthe immeasurable universe, yet He notes the sparrow\u2019s fall and hears the\nfaintest cry. He made the galaxies, but He stooped to Bethlehem\u2019s manger.\nBelievers tremble before His majesty but also seek solace in His unconditional\nlove. This is the Christian\u2019s God. There are, however, different views held by\nthose who ignore the scriptural doctrine of God.\n3 William Foxwell Albright, The Archaeology of Palestine and the Bible (Old Tappan, NJ: Fleming H. Revell\nPublishing Company, 1933) 127, 128.\n\n1. Atheism: Atheists deny the existence of any deity. They believe the\nuniverse came about by chance, or that it has always existed and is sustained\nby resident, impersonal laws. There are two kinds of atheists: (1) the philo-\nsophical atheist who denies that God exists and (2) the practical atheist who\nlives as if God does not exist.\n2. Agnosticism: Agnostics do not deny the existence of God. Rather, they\ndeny the possibility of truly knowing whether or not God exists. Professor\nThomas Huxley coined the word agnostic from the inscription \u201cAgnosto Theo\u201d\n(the unknown god) found on the Athen\u2019s altar the apostle Paul referenced in\nActs 17:23. Paul used this reference to the unknown god in a very different\nmanner than Huxley. In fact, Paul referred to the Athenian \u201cunknown god\u201d\nas the only real God. In contrast, the other Athenian deities were only human\nheroes or myths elevated to the status of gods by the Greeks. Paul\u2019s entire\nmessage was centered upon declaring the \u201cknowability\u201d of God. Agnostics\nquestion the ability to know God. However, the Bible assures every person\nthat God is close and knowable.\n3. Materialism: Materialists deny the existence of spirit or spiritual\nbeings. They believe reality is merely matter in motion. Materialists believe\nthe human mind and soul are only functions of the physical brain developed\nover billions of years by gradual evolution. In this view of existence, there is\nno life after death; heaven and hell are only earthly states of pleasure or pain,\nsuccess or failure. If materialists are consistent in their logic, they have no real\nbasis for morality because doing good would only be doing what brings the\ngreatest pleasure to the greatest number. With a materialist worldview, there\nis no reason for individuals to feel a deep obligation to be moral other than to\navoid losing esteem because there is no judgment above the human level, and\nsin is only an issue of imperfection.\n4. Pantheism: Pantheists believe that everything is God or that there is no\nseparation between God and the natural world. The term comes from theos\nmeaning \u201cgod\u201d and pan meaning \u201call.\u201d Philosophers Spinoza and Hegel were\nthe best known European pantheists. Hinduism and Taoism are rooted in\npantheism along with other eastern religions. Pantheism argues against the\n\nconcept of a personal God. Rather, spiritual enlightenment is often viewed as\nachieving the desireless, passionless, soulless state of nirvana.\n5. Polytheism: Polytheists believe in many gods. The word comes from\nthe Greek poly, meaning \u201cmany\u201d and theos, meaning \u201cgod.\u201d Many ancient\ncultures believed every facet of nature was ruled over by a god or goddess.\nSome people groups believed that their tribal heroes became deities ruling\nover rivers, rainfall, agriculture, human passions, various planets, seasons of\nthe year and other natural or supernatural phenomena. Israel\u2019s neighbors were\npolytheists, and polytheism often corrupted Israel\u2019s worship even though the\nBible strongly condemns the practice of worshiping and believing in other\ngods (Isa. 44:9-20).\n6. Deism: This word comes from the Latin word deus which means\n\u201cgod.\u201d Deists believe in a transcendent but \u201cabsentee\u201d God. This God made\nthe universe and humankind but left His creation to sustain itself by natural\nlaws. Deists usually deny humanity\u2019s sinful nature and the need for atone-\nment or a redeemer. Deists believe God is distant. They reject miracles as well\nas the divine inspiration of Scripture.\n7. Dualism: Dualists believe in the existence of two opposite yet equal\nrealms. These may be thought of as spirit versus matter, light versus dark\nor good versus evil. Zoroaster, a Persian philosopher of Moses\u2019 time, first\nadvanced the idea of two gods of equal power, neither triumphing over the\nother. The Bible teaches of good and evil; however, Satan and God are not\nequal in force, authority, power or substance. Satan is a created being. God\nis God! God\u2019s Kingdom will triumph over Satan. The light and life of God\nwill vanquish all evil and darkness. Gnostics and Manicheans in post-ap-\nostolic times were dualists, teaching that all matter was evil and that only\nspirit was good. The New Testament does not have a dualist view of matter\nand spirit. Scripture teaches that material things may be good and useful to\nGod\u2019s kingdom when they are managed with a dedicated stewardship and\nyielded to God and His purposes. See 1 Corinthians 3:21-23 and 1 Timothy\n6:17. Ultimately, dualism denies the incarnational power of the gospel of\nJesus Christ.\n\nIII. The Nature of God\nIt is important to study the nature of God with humility and reverence,\nfor God\u2019s magnificent essence surpasses human comprehension. God pro-\nclaimed through the prophet Isaiah, \u201cFor as the heavens are higher than the\nearth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your\nthoughts\u201d (Isa. 55:9). Even so, God has revealed as much of His essential\nnature to us as is needed to serve and worship Him. Although the Bible does\nnot provide a single, comprehensive definition of God, it is still important\nto articulate a view of God\u2019s nature that aligns with Scripture. The following\nhistorical definition serves as a good starting point: \u201cGod is a Spirit, Infinite,\nEternal, and Unchangeable in his Being, Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice,\nGoodness and Truth.\u201d4 Several statements about God in Scripture also help\nus define various aspects of His nature: \u201cGod is Spirit\u2026\u201d (John 4:24); \u201cGod\nis light\u2026\u201d (1 John 1:5); \u201c\u2026God is love\u201d (1 John 4:8), and \u201c\u2026God is a con-\nsuming fire\u201d (Heb. 12:29). The following section will focus upon four aspects\nof God\u2019s nature.\nA. God is Spirit\nThe statement that God is Spirit means He is not limited to a physical\nbody or to the dimensions of space and time. He is the invisible, eternal God:\n\u201cNo one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the\nbosom of the Father, He has declared Him\u201d (John 1:18). Jesus pointed out\nthat a person must be \u201cborn of the Spirit\u201d to enter the kingdom of God (John\n3:5). Since \u201cGod is Spirit\u2026those who worship Him must worship in spirit\nand truth\u201d (John 4:24).\nSome difficulties arise when individuals attempt to grasp the concept\nthat God is Spirit. First, some Bible passages seem to represent God as having\nhuman features such as eyes, ears or arms (Isa. 52:10; Ps. 34:15). These ref-\nerences are figures of speech called anthropomorphisms (meaning \u201cmanlike\u201d).\nWhen God is described as having \u201cears\u201d to hear a cry or \u201carms\u201d to provide\nhelp, the figurative language is employed to help readers comprehend God in\n4 The Westminster Catechism.\n\nrelatable human terms. Although human imagery is used to describe certain\nattributes of God, it is important to realize that God\u2019s nature contrasts the\nlimits of humanity:\n\u201cTo whom then will you liken Me, Or to whom shall\nI be equal?\u201d says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on\nhigh, And see who has created these things, Who brings\nout their host by number; He calls them all by name,\nBy the greatness of His might And the strength of His\npower; Not one is missing. Why do you say, O Jacob,\nAnd speak, O Israel: \u201cMy way is hidden from the\nLORD, And my just claim is passed over by my God?\u201d\nHave you not known? Have you not heard? The ever-\nlasting God, the LORD, The Creator of the ends of the\nearth, Neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is\nunsearchable (Isa. 40:25-28).\nThe Eternal Spirit does not need eyes to see people\u2019s need, nor is He\nwearied in His redeeming activity. God is not limited by earthly constraints.\nAnother difficulty in understanding God as Spirit is that in the Old\nTestament God is sometimes represented as appearing in human form (see\nGen.17-19; Josh. 5:13-15). For example, God appeared to Abraham to assure\nhim that he would have a promised son who would bless all nations. This\nappearance and other visible manifestations of God are called theophanies.\nSuch appearances, however, do not contradict the reality of God as Spirit.\nAlthough God is in essence Spirit, He can also assume any form that best\nsuits His purposes.\nThe greatest mystery in comprehending God as Spirit is found in what\nGod the Son did when He took on human form to become the believer\u2019s\nRedeemer, High Priest and Eternal King. Although God is Spirit, the Son of\nGod became the incarnate manifestation of God. In other words, Jesus was\nGod in the flesh, dwelling among us. Jesus said to Philip, \u201c\u2026he who has seen\nMe has seen the Father\u2026\u201d (John 14:9). Although Jesus was God in the flesh,\nHe was not limited by the flesh. After the resurrection, Jesus had a spiritual\n\nbody that was not subject to natural, physical limitations (John 20:19-29)\nalthough there is some indication that Jesus may, in His spiritual body, eter-\nnally bear the marks of Calvary\u2019s suffering.\nB. God is perfect\nJesus said to His disciples, \u201cTherefore you shall be perfect, just as your\nFather in heaven is perfect\u201d (Matt. 5:48). God is complete perfection, truth\nand holiness. All of His ways are blameless. He is pure righteousness and\ncomplete love. His ways and His being are beyond reproach. There is nothing\ndirty, unclean or incomplete in God. God is holy and therefore wholly perfect\n(Lev. 11:44; 1 Pet. 1:16).\nC. God is personal\nA personal being possesses self-consciousness, intellect, feeling and will.\nThe God of Holy Scriptures is personal. Although God is a transcendent God\nwho stands apart from the universe as its creator, He is also at the same time,\nan immanent God who resides within His creation, preserving and caring for\nHis creation as a heavenly Father.\nThe personality of God is revealed in His dealing with Moses when He\ndeclared His personal name Yahweh (Exod. 3:14; 6:2-3), which both clarifies\nHis identity and reflects His character. The name of God, Yahweh, is derived\nfrom the Hebrew \u201cto be\u201d verb. \u201cI AM THAT I AM\u201d is one possible transla-\ntion of Yahweh. In revealing His meaningful name to Israel, God showed that\nHe was not merely an impersonal soul of the universe but rather a relational,\npersonal God. His actions demonstrate this as well. God spoke and entered\ninto a covenant with the Israelites as an intelligent being. He answered the\ninquiries of Moses as one who empathizes with and responds to human anx-\nieties, fears and feelings. He personally chose a man to carry out His will and\nlead Israel as a witness nation among nations. He heard the groanings of His\npeople in Egypt. Their anguish mattered to Him. The Israelites were not\nled by a distant, uncaring, impersonal force. Rather, they were directed by a\npersonal God.\n\nThe most convincing display of God\u2019s personal nature occurred in the\nredemptive work of Jesus Christ, \u201cWho, being in the form of God, did not\nconsider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputa-\ntion, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.\nAnd being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became\nobedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross\u201d (Phil. 2:6-8).\nGod literally spared no expense to save His children from their own sins. He\ntook on flesh and gave His own life as a perfect sacrifice for the sins of those\nHe created. Such redeeming love cannot come from an impersonal principle;\nlove is a personal characteristic of a personal God.\nD. God is One\nThe Law of God given on Sinai begins with the declaration, \u201cHear, O\nIsrael: The LORD our God, the LORD is one!\u201d (Deut. 6:4). The nations\nsurrounding Israel worshiped many false gods represented by images and\nidols. Israel\u2019s downfall resulted from the people\u2019s continual flirtation with\nthese deities. Israel\u2019s King Ahab introduced the worship of Baal, a false nature\ngod. Elijah confronted this idol worship by challenging the priests of Baal\nand Ashtoreth to a spectacular contest with Yahweh, the living God (1 Kings\n18:21-40). Yahweh answered Elijah\u2019s prayer by consuming a waterlogged sac-\nrifice with fire. In response to this miracle, the Israelites acknowledged in\none accord that Yahweh is the only true God. Consequently, the catastrophic\ntrend toward polytheism was temporarily halted.\nThe uncompromising call for the worship of the one true God resonates\nthroughout Scripture. Isaiah declared, \u201cThus says the Lord, the King of Israel,\nAnd his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: \u2018I am the First and I am the Last;\nBesides Me there is no God\u2019\u201d (Isa. 44:6). Jesus championed the same great\ntruth as He prayed to the Father: \u201cAnd this is eternal life, that they may know\nYou, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent\u201d (John 17:3).\nThe apostle Paul commended the Thessalonians for having turned away from\nidols to the true God (1 Thess. 1:9). Some have thought that religion evolved\nfrom animism and polytheism to monotheism. However, archeological and\nmissiological evidence indicates early cultures were originally monotheistic\nbefore developing an increasingly corrupted view of God. Although a proper\n\nunderstanding of the Trinity will be addressed later, it is important to first\nclearly establish that God is one God.\nIV. The Names of God\nScripture employs a number of names for God. In Jewish culture names\noften represented an attribute or characteristic of the person named. Thus,\nthe names of God that appear in the Bible are significant because they provide\ninsight into God\u2019s character and personhood.\nA. The Old Testament personal, covenantal name of God\nYahweh (Heb. YHWH) is the personal name of God revealed to God\u2019s\nchosen people. Although scholars disagree on the exact etymology of YHWH,\nit is quite certain that God\u2019s name is a variant of the \u201cto be\u201d verb. The context\nof Moses\u2019 encounter with Yahweh lends credence to the notion that God\u2019s\nname is, in fact, translated something akin to \u201cI AM\u201d or \u201cI AM WHO I AM\u201d:\nThen Moses said to God, \u201cIndeed, when I come to the\nchildren of Israel and say to them, \u2018The God of your\nfathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they say to me, \u2018What\nis His name?\u2019 what shall I say to them?\u201d And God said\nto Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d And He said, \u201cThus\nyou shall say to the children of Israel, \u2018I Am has sent\nme to you.\u2019\u201d Moreover God said to Moses, \u201cThus you\nshall say to the children of Israel; \u2018The LORD (Yahweh)\nGod of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of\nIsaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is\nMy name forever, and this is My memorial to all gener-\nations\u2019\u201d (Exod. 3:13-15).\nIn disclosing his personal name to Moses, Yahweh invited His creation\nto call upon Him and to know Him personally. In revealing His name to His\ncreation, God revealed Himself as the one true God, the sovereign over all\n\nother powers, the great \u201cI AM.\u201d His name speaks of His autonomous, self-de-\ntermined, perfectly complete nature. The self-disclosure of His name carries\nsignificance in that it not only identified God to the Israelites but also allowed\nthe Israelites to identify themselves with God. More than a generic title for a\ndeity, God\u2019s personal, covenantal name is Yahweh. Therefore He is known as\n\u201cLORD (Yahweh) our God\u201d (Exod. 3:18).\nYahweh occurs in the Old Testament 5,321 times and is usually translated\nLORD in all capital letters. The Hebrew form of the divine name is YHWH,\nbut the exact pronunciation is uncertain as the Israelites eventually stopped\npronouncing God\u2019s name for fear of violating the commandment to not take\nthe name of \u201cThe LORD (YHWH) in vain\u201d (Exod. 20:7). Vowels did not\nappear in the original Hebrew Masoretic text. However, when vowels were\nadded for pronunciation, the vowels for Adonai, \u201cmy Lord,\u201d were mixed with\nthe consonants of YHWH to keep readers from accidentally saying the name\nof God out loud. Furthermore, the Greek translation of the Old Testament\n(LXX) rendered YHWH as kyrios, \u201cLord.\u201d Most scholars believe the correct\npronunciation is Yahweh. An abbreviated form of Yahweh is Yah, which essen-\ntially has the same meaning. Yah is found 48 times in the Old Testament. It\noccurs mostly in Psalms and is always used in a context of praise (Ps. 68:4).\nIn the New Testament, Jesus identified Himself with the divine name by pro-\nclaiming, \u201c\u2026Before Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58). Throughout the Old\nTestament, the personal, covenantal name of God is also paired with other\nterms to express the nature of God\u2019s relationship with humanity.

Other Old Testament names of God\n1. Elohim, plural; Eloah, singular: Elohim is the first word used in\nScripture for God (Gen. 1:1). It is used approximately 2,500 times in the\nOld Testament. Its probable root meaning is \u201cstrong and mighty one.\u201d The\nname Elohim, like the word \u201cgod\u201d in English, may refer to the true God, to\npagan gods or even to human dignitaries. When used with the definite article,\nElohim almost always refers the one true God of Israel.\na) El, \u201cGod, god, mighty one, strength\u201d (Deut. 32:4): El is an ancient\nand generic reference for \u201cdeity\u201d or \u201cgod\u201d that is found in some form in\nall of the Semitic (ancient Near Eastern) languages. While the polythe-\nistic nations surrounding Israel used this term in reference to their gods,\nin the Bible, El usually refers to the true God of Israel. The term does\nnot frequently appear alone but is most often used as a compound with\nother concrete, descriptive terms such as El Elyon (\u201cGod Most High\u201d),\nEl Shaddai (\u201cGod Almighty\u201d). El also occurs in common names, as in\nDaniel, meaning \u201cGod is my judge.\u201d This name, as well as most of the\ncommon divine names, is found in Deuteronomy 32.\nb) El Elyon, \u201cthe Most High\u201d [from alah which means \u201cto ascend\u201d]\n(Deut. 32:8): El Elyon is identified with the one true God of Israel. He is\npictured as the powerful Creator of heaven and earth: \u201cThen Melchizedek\nking of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most\nHigh [El Elyon]. And he blessed him and said: \u2018Blessed be Abram of God\nMost High [El Elyon], Possessor of heaven and earth; And blessed be God\n\nMost High [El Elyon], Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.\u2019\nAnd he gave him a tithe of all\u201d (Gen. 14:18-20).\nc) El Olam, \u201cthe Everlasting God\u201d: Since \u201cOlam designates the\n\u2018fullness\u2019 (totality) of the experience of time and space,\u201d5 the thought\nconveyed by El Olam is not only the eternal duration of God but also\nHis everlasting faithfulness. As recorded in Genesis, Abraham called\non Yahweh, the Everlasting God [El Olam], who keeps His covenants:\n\u201cThen Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on\nthe name of the LORD, the Everlasting God [El Olam]\u201d (Gen. 21:33).\nWhile El Olam does not occur prolifically in Scripture, this same concept\nof God is consistent with other passages of the Bible in which God is por-\ntrayed as a solid and perpetual dwelling place (e.g., \u201ceverlasting Rock,\u201d\nIsa. 26:4, NASB).\nd) El Shaddai, \u201cthe Almighty God\u201d: A number of Biblical texts refer\nto the God of Israel as El Shaddai. The first occurrence is in Genesis 17:1\n(see also Gen. 28:3; 35:11; 43:14; 48:3; Exod. 6:3). The title\u2019s origin,\nhistory and etymology are relatively uncertain, but the general emphasis\nof the name El Shaddai is God\u2019s omnipotence. The compound form, El\nShaddai, is found seven times; the single word Shaddai meaning \u201cthe\nAlmighty\u201d is found 41 times, 31 times in Job alone.\n2. Adonai (pl.); Adon (sing.), \u201cLord, lord, master, ruler\u201d: The terms\n\u201cadon\u201d and \u201cadonai\u201d may be translated \u201clord.\u201d They can refer to a person who\nis a master or ruler: \u201cTherefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, \u2018After I\nhave grown old, shall I have pleasure, my lord [adonai] being old also?\u2019\u201d (Gen.\n18:12). The terms can also refer to the Lord God as the Master of everything:\n\u201c\u2026I saw the Lord [Adonai] sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the\ntrain of His robe filled the temple\u201d (Isa. 6:1). Adonai is used in reference to\nthe Lord 449 times throughout Scripture. The title evokes images of royalty\nand denotes a relationship of distinct authority.\n5 The Anchor Bible Dictionary, ed. David Noel Freedman (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1992), vol. 1, 1004.\n\n3. Ha Tsur, \u201cThe Rock\u201d: The metaphorical name for Yahweh, Ha Tsur, is\nfound five times in Deuteronomy 32. The first instance is in verse 4: \u201cHe is\nthe Rock, His work is perfect\u2026\u201d This term stresses the stability, faithfulness,\nsurety and immutability of God, the Rock of Ages (see also Deut. 32:15, 18,\n30-31; Ps. 19:14; Isa. 17:10; 26:4; 32:2; 51:1). In the New Testament, the\napostle Paul refers to this image when he writes \u201c\u2026For they drank of that\nspiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ\u201d (1 Cor. 10:4).\nC. New Testament names of God\n1. Theos, \u201cGod or god\u201d: Theos is applied to both God the Father and to\nJesus: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word [logos], and the Word was with God\n[Theos], and the Word was God [Theos]\u201d (John 1:1). The Greek word theos,\nlike elohim, can mean \u201cGod\u201d or \u201cgods.\u201d It is the standard word for \u201cGod\u201d in\nthe New Testament.\n2. Kurios, \u201cLord or lord\u201d: Kurios is the Greek word for \u201cLord\u201d and is\nthe predominant term used to translate the divine name Yahweh in the LXX\n(Greek translation of the Old Testament). All three New Testament divine\nnames are used in the following verse: \u201cAnd that every tongue should confess\nthat Jesus Christ is Lord [Kurios], to the glory of God [Theos] the Father\n[Pater]\u201d (Phil. 2:11).\n3. Pater, \u201cFather\u201d: In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus called God\nHis Father with both the Greek word Pater and the Aramaic word Abba.\nBelievers have been given this same privilege because of Christ\u2019s work of\nredemption; we may call upon the Omnipotent One as our heavenly Father.\n\u201c\u2026But you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \u2018Abba,\nFather\u2019\u201d (Rom. 8:15).\n\nV. The Attributes of God\nGod\u2019s unparalleled glory makes it impossible to fully illustrate His char-\nacter and nature. Even so, God has made Himself known. Through Scripture\nGod has revealed to us the aspects of His nature He deems essential for our\nredemption and ability to worship and fellowship with Him. Consider the\nfollowing Scripture:\n\u201cTo whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?\u201d\nsays the Holy One. Lift your eyes and look to the heav-\nens: who created all these? He who brings out the starry\nhost one by one, and calls forth each of them by name.\nBecause of his great power and mighty strength, not\none of them is missing. Why do you complain, Jacob?\nWhy do you say, Israel, \u201cMy way is hidden from the\nLord; my cause is disregarded by my God\u201d? Do you not\nknow? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlast-\ning God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will\nnot grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one\ncan fathom (Isa. 40:25-28, NIV).\nThis passage extols God as both creator and provider demonstrating His\npower, wisdom, providence and immutability. This is just one small passage\nof Old Testament scripture. When we consider the entirety of the Scripture\nand the revelation of God through Jesus Christ, the Bible becomes an invalu-\nably rich and living source for understanding the attributes of God. While it\nis not easy to categorize the attributes of God, two general classifications may\nbe identified: \u201cabsolute\u201d attributes and \u201cmoral\u201d attributes. Absolute attributes\nare those characteristics belonging to God alone; moral attributes are those\ncharacteristics God shares with humans to a limited degree.\nA. Absolute attributes\n1. God is self-existent: He is the absolute source of all life and being, the\nUncaused Cause: \u201cFor as the Father has life in Himself; so He has granted\nthe Son to have life in Himself\u201d (John 5:26). God is not one in a series of\n\nemanations. He is the Eternal Living God, Creator of all beings and all things\nthat have ever existed (Col. 1:17). God\u2019s being or essence is not dependent\nupon any source outside Himself. He is self-existent.\n2. God is immutable: The immutability of God means His character\nnever changes. God is forever faithful, dependable and steadfast: \u201cFor I am\nthe LORD, I do not change\u2026\u201d (Mal. 3:6). The author of Hebrews wrote:\n\u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Heb. 13:8). God will\nnot fail in His love, His truth and His grace because His essence is unchang-\ning. All of the covenants and promises of God are as reliable as the founda-\ntions of heaven. Although humans are inconsistent and disobedient in their\nrelationship with God, this does not compromise the faithfulness of God.\nPsalms states, \u201cYour faithfulness endures to all generations; You established\nthe earth, and it abides\u201d (Ps. 119:90).\n3. God is eternal: He exists outside the boundaries of time and space.\nScripture declares, \u201c\u2026Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God\u201d\n(Ps. 90:2b). God\u2019s existence spans from everlasting past to everlasting future.\nRevelation states, \u201c\u2018I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the\nEnd,\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty\u2019\u201d\n(Rev. 1:8). Believers have hope for everlasting life, for the Eternal God is the\ngiver of eternal life through His Son.\n4. God is omnipresent: He is everywhere present. God said through the\nprophet Jeremiah, \u201c\u2018Am I a God near at hand,\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018And not a God\nafar off? Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall not see him?\u2019\nsays the Lord; \u2018Do I not fill heaven and earth?\u2019 says the Lord\u201d (Jer. 23:23-24).\nGod is everywhere present. Believers have wonderful, scriptural assurance\nthat everywhere they pray, worship or serve, God is there. It is equally true\nthat everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved, no matter\nwhere they are on the face of the earth.\n5. God is omniscient: He is all-knowing. People are limited to the sphere\nof human understanding, but God sees all and knows all. Two aspects of God\u2019s\n\u201call knowledge\u201d are emphasized in Scripture. First, God is aware of every-\nthing. Humans cannot hide their actions nor their thoughts from God. For\n\nexample, He brought to light and judged the deceitful schemes of Ananias\nand Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). In His instructions to the seven churches of Asia,\nthe Lord clearly described both the activity and inward spiritual condition\nof each gathered community (Rev. 2:13-22). Nothing escapes God\u2019s vision.\nSecond, God is allwise in His plans and purposes. He knows all things from\nthe beginning. He has, in His wisdom, planned the redemption of His people,\nthe building of His church and the triumph of His kingdom (Eph. 1:9-10;\n3:8-11). Although humans have freedom of will and choice, God has already\nestablished plans He will carry to completion. Furthermore, \u201c\u2026we know that\nall things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the\ncalled according to His purpose\u201d (Rom. 8:28).\n6. God is omnipotent: He is all-powerful. Nothing is beyond His abil-\nity to accomplish (Jer. 32:17). God\u2019s power is maintained in perfect balance\nwith His perfect character. Some have asked, \u201cIf God is all powerful, then\nwhy does the Scripture say He cannot lie, sin or deny Himself?\u201d This phil-\nosophical musing fails to take into account one important factor: God will\nnot do anything contrary to His nature or anything that is a contradiction in\nterms. His seeming \u201cinability\u201d to perform such tasks is not due to a lack of\npower. Rather, God will always display His power in perfect harmony with\nHis resolute and unfaltering character. The following areas evidence that God\nis omnipotent:\na) God\u2019s creative power: The vastness of the universe staggers human\nimagination. We have been \u201cfearfully and wonderfully made\u201d by an awe-\nsomely powerful Creator (Ps. 139:13-16).\nb) God\u2019s sovereign rule: One of the most convincing evidences of\nGod\u2019s power is the fulfillment of biblical prophecies showing God does\nindeed rule the affairs of kings and nations. Through a series of astound-\ning miracles, God delivered Israel from slavery (Exod. 14:30-31). God\u2019s\nrule exceeds all human authority. He is sovereign over the earth, ruling\nover angels, principalities and powers, demon spirits and Satan himself.\nGod rules in heaven, on earth and under the earth (Rom. 8:37-39; Phil.\n2:6-11).\n\nc) God\u2019s power through the church: More than two thousand years\nago, God, through His Son, selected 12 seemingly ordinary disciples.\nJesus Christ saved these disciples and filled them with the Holy Spirit.\nImmediately they \u201cturned the world upside down\u201d (Acts 17:6). The same\nchurch that was empowered in the upper room at Pentecost remains\nvital, influential and ever-expanding in its impact on the world today.\nd) God\u2019s power over death: On the day of Pentecost, Peter explained\nthat King David\u2019s body remained buried in a tomb; however, Jesus was no\nlonger dead but living (Acts 2:29-32). Only God holds the keys of eternal\nlife. It is because of the resurrection of Christ that Paul said, in agree-\nment with the prophet Isaiah, \u201cBut when this perishable will have put\non the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then\nwill come about the saying that is written, \u2018DEATH IS SWALLOWED\nUP in victory. O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH,\nWHERE IS YOUR STING?\u2019\u201d (1 Cor. 15:54-55, NASB). Believers share\nin the hope of the resurrection for everlasting spiritual life, and we will\nall partake of the power that was at work in the life and resurrection of\nJesus (Eph. 1:18-20).\n7. God is sovereign: He has supreme, permanent authority. However,\nmuch debate revolves around the interplay between God\u2019s sovereignty and\nhumankind\u2019s free will. Paul stated in Ephesians that God has \u201c\u2026predestined\nus to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good\npleasure of His will\u201d (Eph. 1:5). This passage seems to imply that each per-\nson\u2019s salvation is predetermined by the will of God. However, it is more likely\nreferring to the fact that God predestined the plan of salvation in Christ\nto be revealed at a specific moment in time, a specific moment that can be\nreceived or rejected by faith. Revelation states, \u201cAnd the Spirit and the bride\nsay, \u2018Come!\u2019 And let him who hears say, \u2018Come!\u2019 And let him who thirsts\ncome. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely\u201d (Rev. 22:17).\nThis passage clearly communicates that the water of life is available to anyone\non the basis of choice and human free will.\nAlthough the Bible portrays God as sovereign, it also portrays humans\nas responsible for the acceptance or rejection of God\u2019s grace (John 3:16). In\n\nother words, God is sovereign but not arbitrary. He is sovereign without vio-\nlating His creation\u2019s essential freedom. To understand the nature of God we\nmust respect the mysterious interplay between humankind\u2019s will and God\u2019s\nwill. On one hand, God said, \u201cI am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning\nand the End, the First and the Last\u201d (Rev. 22:13). God is the author and\nfinisher of our faith (Heb. 12:2). On the other hand, humans are \u201cwithout\nexcuse,\u201d accountable for their acceptance or rejection of the gospel (Rom.\n1:20). Any theological attempt to explain the sovereignty of God is clearly\nlimited by humankind\u2019s finite perspective. Even so, a healthy Biblical perspec-\ntive must hold these truths in proper tension.\nB. Moral attributes\nThe following are characteristics God shares with humans to a lim-\nited degree:\n1. God is holy: The Hebrew word for \u201choly\u201d is quadosh; it is defined in\nOld Testament Word Studies: \u201cAscribed to all those things which in any way\npertain to God, or his worship; sacred; free from defilement of vice, idolatry,\nand other impure and profane things.\u201d6 The Greek word is hagios, which is\ndefined in the Greek Lexicon: \u201cDedicated to God, holy, sacred; reserved for\nGod and his service; pure, perfect, worthy of God, consecrated.\u201d7 God is\nholy; separate and exalted, absolutely perfect in every way (Isa. 6:13). For\nhumans, holiness is an issue of dedication and consecration, the quality of\nbeing separated to God. Things are holy when dedicated exclusively to the\nworship and service of God. People are holy if they are wholly God\u2019s people.\nIn the Old Testament, Israel is called a holy nation (Exod. 19:6). In the New\nTestament, the Lord\u2019s people are called \u201csaints\u201d meaning \u201choly ones\u201d (Rom.\n1:7). Holiness also means separation from all defilement and from all forms\nof idolatry. Israel\u2019s adulterous worship of pagan deities was a perpetual defile-\nment of God\u2019s call for Israel to be holy, separate and distinct from their pagan\nneighbors. In the New Testament, holiness is presented as the fruit of Christ\u2019s\n6 William Wilson, Old Testament Word Studies (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 1978) s.v.\n\u201cquadosh.\u201d\n7 William F. Arndt and F. Wilbur Gingrich, Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament (Chicago: University\nof Chicago Press, 1957) s.v. \u201chagios.\u201d\n\natonement (Col. 1:21-22). Thus, purity of life and separation from immoral-\nity is understood to be the sanctifying overflow of a transformed, Spirit-filled\nlife (see Rom. 6:19-22; 12:1-2; 2 Cor. 7:1; Eph. 4:24; 1 Thess. 3:13; 4:7; Tit.\n2:3; Heb. 12:10-14; 1 Pet. 1:15-16; 2 Pet. 3:11).\n2. God is righteousness (justice): God\u2019s perfect character is reflected in\nHis perfect deeds. God\u2019s righteousness is His holiness in action. His justice is\nHis righteousness in rule and government. The Hebrew word for \u201crighteous\u201d\nis tsedek, which means \u201cRightness, straightness, rectitude; justice of a judge, of\na king, of God exhibited in punishing the wicked, or in avenging, delivering,\nrewarding the righteous.\u201d8 Another Hebrew word related to righteousness is\nmishpat, which means \u201crighteous judgment as a judge.\u201d The Greek word for\n\u201crighteous\u201d is dikaios, which means \u201cof God\u2014just, righteous, with reference\nto his judgment of men and nations, a righteous judge; of men\u2014upright,\njust, righteous conforming to the laws of God and man, and living in accor-\ndance with them.\u201d9 God is righteous because He acts at all times in complete\nconformity with His holy nature and will. God\u2019s righteousness is immutable.\nFor example, He is called a \u2018Rock\u2019 five times in Deuteronomy 32. His righ-\nteousness never changes, and His justice is unfailing. He is faithful in dealing\nwith His people according to His nature and His revealed laws and covenants.\nHe will both punish and reward, but always according to His promises and\ncovenants. All His decisions are just, and all His ways are upright. In the New\nTestament, the English words \u201crighteousness\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d are translations\nof the same Greek word. This is seen in the definition of the word \u201cjustifica-\ntion,\u201d which means \u201cthe act of declaring one righteous.\u201d\nGod requires perfect righteousness from all of us, but in our fallen state,\nwe all fall short of perfection. God\u2019s grace, appropriated through faith in\nJesus, has provided a new basis for righteousness (Rom. 3:21-26). God made\na way to justify sinners by sending His infinite Son to be the perfect sacrifice\nfor sin. Jesus Christ lived in perfect obedience to the holy will of the Father.\nThe Father offered Jesus as the punishment for our rebellion. On the cross,\nJesus Christ became the punishment for our sins. In dying for our sins, Jesus\ndemonstrated the righteousness of God, for God both condemned sin and\n8 Wilson, s.v. \u201ctsedek.\u201d\n9 Arndt and Gingerich, s.v. \u201cdikaios.\u201d\n\nfreed sinners through the death and resurrection of His Son (Rom. 3:26).\nConsequently, in Christ we stand fully righteous before God.\n3. God is love (mercy, goodness): Scripture states, \u201c\u2026God is love.\nWhoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them\u201d (1 John 4:16). Perhaps\nall of God\u2019s moral attributes are encompassed in His holiness and in His love.\nIn His holiness He is unapproachable; in His love He approaches us. In His\nholiness He is transcendent; in His love He is immanent. For fallen humanity\nthese two seemingly irreconcilable attributes are brought together through\nthe finished, atoning work of Christ. In Christ the demands of holiness are\nsatisfied, and the outpouring of love is realized. The Hebrew word for love\nis ahab. It shares a similar range of meanings with the English word and can\nexpress both divine love and human love. In Deuteronomy God expressed\nHis love for His chosen people and clearly communicated that love was the\nbasis of His covenant with Israel (Deut. 7:6-8). God\u2019s love is evident through-\nout Israel\u2019s history in His patience, provision and longsuffering. In the face of\nIsrael\u2019s perpetual complaining and rebellion, God has remained faithful. In\nthe New Testament, several Greek words are used for love. However, when\nreference is made to God\u2019s love, agape is typically used. The noun agape is\nscarcely found in classical Greek writings. Consequently, our understanding\nof its meaning is rooted in the Scripture. The apostle John gave us a great\nexample of the nature of agape when he wrote, \u201cFor God so loved the world\nthat He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should\nnot perish but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16). Other virtues such as mercy,\nlongsuffering, goodness, forgiveness and compassion fit within the category\nof God\u2019s love. Along with being an attribute of God, love is also a defining\ncharacteristic of Christian witness. Jesus stated, \u201cBy this all will know that\nyou are My disciples, if you have love for one another\u201d (John 13:35).\n4. God is truth: The introduction of John\u2019s gospel unequivocally states\nthat God is full of both grace and truth (John 1:14). Later in John, Jesus pro-\nclaimed, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father\nexcept through Me\u201d (John 14:6). Truth is a part of God\u2019s holy nature and\ncould rightly be discussed under the heading of holiness and righteousness.\nHowever, truth may also be viewed as a distinct attribute of God. The follow-\ning are three reassuring applications concerning God and truth:\n\na) The Word of God is true: God\u2019s Word reveals His nature, will and\nplan of salvation. God\u2019s promises and covenants are made in truth and\nare, therefore, unfailingly dependable (Ps. 119:89; John 17:17).\nb) God is the only true God: As the creator of all things, God is\nthe only one worthy of worship. All idolatry is rooted in deception and\nlies. God is truth! Therefore, His truth is the only truth worth following\n(John 4:23-24).\nc) Because God is truth, He is faithful to keep all His promises and\ncovenants. God cannot lie (Tit. 1:2; Heb. 6:18). He keeps and fulfills\nall His promises. God is able to do what He promises because He is\nomnipotent. However, it is important to understand that the fulfillment\nof God\u2019s promises often depends upon the obedience of His creation\nand the wisdom of His timing. God in His infinite wisdom and perfect\ntiming will faithfully fulfill all His promises (1 Kings 8:56; 2 Cor. 1:20;\nHeb. 10:23; 2 Pet. 3:9).\nVI. The Works of God\nA. Divine purpose\nThe Bible declares that even in the face of willful human rebellion, God\u2019s\npurpose stands firm (Isa. 14:24; Eph.1:11). All the events and activities of\neach nation and every individual have been known by God from the begin-\nning. God\u2019s purpose and plan has taken into account the activity of rebellious,\nwillful humans. Although God does not cause human rebellion, He does\nwork all human activity to His ultimate glory. God spoke in Isaiah through\nHis prophet, \u201cDeclaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times\nthings that are not yet done, Saying, \u2018My counsel shall stand, and I will do\nall My pleasure\u2019\u2026Indeed I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have\npurposed it; I will also do it\u201d (Isa. 46:10-11). God is omniscient, knowing all\nthings from the beginning. He will carry out His plans and purposes in His\npower and wisdom for His glory and for the redemption of His people.\n\nGod created humans with freedom of will to obey or disobey. The Bible\ndoes not say why God permitted sin, evil or even human choice. Even so, we\nhave strong intimations that a redeemed people demonstrates God\u2019s glory\nand love vastly more than a race of conforming automatons. Regardless, it is\ncertain that God is not the author of sin (Jas. 1:13-15). Depravity, pain and\ncrime resulted from humanity\u2019s disobedience. Before God created human-\nkind, He had already purposed to bring redemption by Christ Jesus (1 Pet.\n1:20). God\u2019s purpose includes His church, and He is aware of each person\nthat will make up that number (Rom. 8:29; Eph. 1:4). This does not indi-\ncate that God arbitrarily elects some and excludes others. Rather, this is an\nissue of the foreknowledge of God (1 Pet. 1:2). The foreknowledge of God is\nnot causative. Ultimately, God\u2019s purpose for all humanity culminates in the\nredemptive work of Christ Jesus; a work that involves the church, the Body\nof Christ. Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus:\nTo me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this\ngrace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles\nthe unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all see\nwhat is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the\nbeginning of the ages has been hidden in God who cre-\nated all things through Jesus Christ; to the intent that\nnow the manifold wisdom of God might be made known\nby the church to the principalities and powers in the\nheavenly places, according to the eternal purpose which\nHe accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord (Eph. 3:8-11).\nB. Creation\nThe Bible states that the original creation was an immediate creation\n(Gen.1:1). The physical universe, as we know it, was spoken into being by\nGod. It did not exist previously in some other form. Rather, God said, \u201cLet\nthere be,\u201d and \u201cthere was\u201d (Gen. 1). Hebrews states, \u201cBy faith we understand\nthat the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are\nseen were not made of things which are visible\u201d (Heb. 11:3). Further, noth-\ning was made apart from God because all things have a divine origin (John\n1:3). Before Genesis, God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit existed.\n\nGod\u2019s full triune nature participated in the creation (Gen. 1:2; John 1:1;\n17:5, 24; Col. 1:16). Before the world was made, the Trinity existed in per-\nfect love. For God so loved the world that He commissioned the Son to the\nwork of redemption before creation, before human existence, and before the\nFall (John 3:16; Eph. 1:4-6). God\u2019s redeeming love was not an afterthought\nbut rather an overflow of His heart. The ultimate result of creation will be a\nredeemed multitude, forever worshiping, serving and glorifying God.\nC. Providence\nGod providentially guides and cares for His creation (Matt. 5:45b; Acts\n14:17). God\u2019s preservation of His creation is a sign of His providence. In\nJesus Christ all things are preserved for \u201c\u2026he is before all things, and in him\nall things hold together\u201d (Col. 1:16-17, ESV). Strong\u2019s Concordance defines\npreservation as \u201cthat continuous agency of God by which He maintains in\nexistence the things He has created together with the properties and pow-\ners with which He has endowed them.\u201d10 Thiessen said of providence: \u201cThe\nChristian view affirms that God has not merely created the universe together\nwith all its properties and powers, and that He is preserving all that He has\ncreated, but that as a holy, benevolent, wise, and omnipotent Being, He also\nexercises sovereign control over it. This sovereign control is called provi-\ndence.\u201d11 Consequently, individuals can find comfort in God\u2019s providential\ncare even in the midst of profound, personal adversity or global calamity. As\nGod considers the lilies, He will also care for His creation (Luke 12:22-28).\nThe following are some of the ways God demonstrates His providential care:\n1. God governs the physical universe: God has set in place natural con-\nditions to regulate the earth. He created the correct proportions of sea and\nland, trade winds and sea currents, evaporation and precipitation to maintain\nweather congenial to life and agriculture. He preserves these processes by His\noversight. Some may survey the world\u2019s varying conditions, such as climate\nand food supplies, and question God\u2019s equity in His care for different people.\nThese seeming inequalities within nature are the result of the curse upon the\nearth that accompanied Adam and Eve\u2019s rebellion (Gen. 3:17-19). However,\n10 Strong, 410.\n11 Thiessen, 177.\n\nto those not blinded by unbelief, even an earth under the curse displays God\u2019s\ndesign and care.\n2. God cares for the animal creation: Not even the smallest creature\u2019s\nwelfare escapes the concern of God (Matt. 6:26a). While animals have been\ngiven instincts that enable them to care for themselves, like people, they also\ndepend upon the creator and sustainer of the earth to provide rain, vegeta-\ntion, oxygen and a stable climate.\n3. God providentially governs the nations: Scripture declares even the\nmightiest nations are \u201cas a drop in a bucket\u201d in the eyes of God (Isa. 40:15).\nHe sovereignly and graciously governs the earth\u2019s kingdoms (Ps. 22:28). It is\nimportant to note God does not ultimately violate free will to make His word\ncome to pass. Likewise, He is not responsible for the individual actions and\nrebellions of people and nations. Even so, in spite of human rebellion, God\nprovidentially governs the world in accordance with His master plan.\n4. God cares about the details of every person\u2019s life: The Lord\u2019s providence\nencompasses the minute, personal aspects of every individual. Scripture states\nthat \u201cthe very hairs of your head are all numbered\u201d by God (Matt. 10:30).\nThe Bible teaches that God has a plan for individuals even before they are\nborn. Jeremiah states, \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before\nyou were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations\u201d (Jer.\n1:5). The psalmist best recognized and reaffirmed this lifelong care of God:\n\u201cMy frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skill-\nfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance,\nbeing yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fash-\nioned for me, When as yet there were none of them\u201d (Ps. 139:14-16).\n5. God provides protection for the righteous: The psalmist wrote, \u201cLet\nthose who love Your name Be joyful in You. For You, O LORD, will bless the\nrighteous; With favor You will surround him as with a shield\u201d (Ps. 5:11-12).\n6. God supplies the needs of His people: God is faithful to provide for\nevery individual\u2019s needs \u201caccording to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus\u201d\n(Phil. 4:19). Jesus told His followers not to worry about food, drink and\n\nclothing, \u201cFor your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.\nBut seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things\nshall be added to you\u201d (Matt. 6:32b-33).\n7. God hears and answers prayer: God knows our needs even before we\nask Him (Matt. 6:7-8). Because God is concerned with every detail of every\nperson\u2019s life, Paul admonished believers to \u201cBe anxious for nothing, but in\neverything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests\nbe made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all under-\nstanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus\u201d (Phil. 4:6).\nGod\u2019s providential care is demonstrated in how He hears, understands and\nanswers our prayers.\nVII. The Trinity (Triunity) of God\nThe study of the Trinity should be undertaken with a deep sense of awe.\nAll theology is limited in defining God. However, the triunity of God is one\nof the greatest divine mysteries. It\u2019s a sacred-ground reality. The nature of\nGod cannot be translated into a simplistic formula any more than the Pacific\nOcean can be transferred into a teacup. Even so, the study of the Trinity is\nvital as it is the center gem of divine revelation. To finite humans, under-\nstanding God as both one and triune appears to be a contradiction. However,\nboth realities are clearly taught throughout the New Testament.\nThroughout church history, whenever the doctrine of the Trinity is com-\npromised, other major Bible tenets have also been compromised, corrupted\nand abandoned. Many church heresies are rooted in a misunderstanding of\nthe persons of the Godhead. In the second century, two major heresies arose\nthat denied the doctrine of the Trinity: Monarchianism and Sabellianism.\nMonarchianism denied the deity of Christ and the personality of the Holy\nSpirit. Sabellianism denied the separate identities of the three persons of\nthe Godhead, declaring that Jesus and the Holy Spirit were only different\nmodes of the one person, or different guises by which God manifested him-\nself. Adherents of both of these groups thought they were guarding the unity\n\nof God. Unitarianism and \u201cJesus Only\u201d or \u201cOneness\u201d doctrines are modern\nexpressions of these heresies.\nThe mainstream of the church has persistently rejected these false teach-\nings. Developed in the fourth century, the Nicene Creed is the earliest creed\nto articulate the orthodox understanding of the Trinity:\nWe believe in one God\u2014And in one Lord Jesus Christ,\nthe Son of God, begotten of the Father, light of light,\nvery God of very God, begotten not made, being of one\nsubstance with the Father\u2014And we believe in the Holy\nGhost, who is the Lord and giver of life, who procee-\ndeth from the Father, who with the Father and Son,\nis worshiped and glorified, who spake by the prophets.\nThe major Protestant bodies have closely followed this ancient creed\nof the fourth century. The best known of the Reformation creeds is the\nWestminster Confession:\nThere is but one living and true God. In the unity of\nthe Godhead there are three persons, of one substance,\npower, and eternity\u2014God the Father, God the Son, and\nGod the Holy Spirit. The Father is one, neither begot-\nten or proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the\nFather; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the\nFather and the Son.\nThese creeds and confessions do not attempt to remove the mystery of\nthe Trinity, nor do they try to reconcile the scriptural statements with finite\nreasoning. Rather, they attest to the stated scriptural record that there is one\nGod: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Although human-produced creeds are cer-\ntainly not infallible, throughout history the majority of the church has held a\nTrinitarian view similar to the Nicene and Athanasian creeds.\n\nA. The concept of the Trinity in the Old Testament\nIt was absolutely essential that the unity of God was clearly articulated\nand emphasized in the Old Testament. Israel was surrounded by polytheis-\ntic nations that had departed from the original knowledge of the one true\nGod. God revealed himself to Abraham as God Almighty (El Shaddai). To\nMoses and the Israelites God revealed Himself as Yahweh (I AM), \u201cThe\nLORD (Yahweh) our God, the LORD (Yahweh) is one!\u201d (Deut. 6:4). The\nOld Testament gives us intimations of the triune nature of God, but they\nare clear only in the light of the New Testament\u2019s fuller revelation of Christ.\nHaving received the deeper insight provided by the Incarnation and the out-\npouring of the Spirit at Pentecost, it is possible to see aspects of the Trinity in\nthe Old Testament.\n1. Plural Names for God: The Old Testament contains plural names and\npronouns for God. Elohim and Adonai are plural forms of God. Even though\nElohim is a plural noun, when used of the true God, it is accompanied by a\nsingular form verb. Deuteronomy 6:4 which declares God\u2019s unity to all Jews,\nalso contains God\u2019s plural name, Elohim. This display of gramatical plurality\nin unity seems to be an intimation of the Trinity.\n2. References to the Angel/Messenger of Yahweh: The Angel of Yahweh is\ncalled God. This term appears a number of times in the book of Genesis and\nfrom time to time in other Old Testament passages. In these scriptures, a dis-\ntinction is made between the Angel of Yahweh and Yahweh, yet they are one. In\nsuch events, when God appears as an angel or as a man, the appearance is called a\ntheophany. Theophany comes from the Greek words theos (God) and phaino (to\nappear) (see Gen. 16:7-13). In Genesis 18, God appeared to Abraham as \u201cthree\nmen,\u201d yet Abraham addressed them as Lord in the singular. Two of the men\nappeared to Lot in Sodom, but he addressed them as Yahweh. In Genesis 22:1-\n19, Abraham was ordered to sacrifice Isaac, but the Angel of the Lord spoke from\nheaven releasing him from the order. In Genesis 22:16, the angel called himself\nYahweh. In Genesis 32:24-32, Jacob wrestled with \u201ca man\u201d and prevailed to\nreceive a divine blessing. In Exodus 3, the Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses\nat the burning bush, giving him the promise that he would lead the Israelites\nout of Egypt. In this conversation with Moses, the terms \u201cAngel\u201d and \u201cYahweh\u201d\n\nwere used interchangeably. Some theologians believe these encounters were\nappearances by the pre-existent Christ, otherwise known as \u201cChristophanies.\u201d\nChristophany comes from the Greek christos (Christ) and phaino (to appear).\n3. Jesus, the commander of the army of the Lord: In Joshua 5:13-6:2, a\n\u201cman\u201d with a drawn sword appeared to Joshua who called himself the \u201ccom-\nmander of the army of the Lord.\u201d Joshua was commanded to loose his shoes\nbecause he was on holy ground. In Joshua 6:2, the \u201cman\u201d is referred to as the\nLORD, or Yahweh. This seems to be another example of a Christophany or\npreincarnate apprearance of Jesus.\n4. Psalmic references to Jesus: The Psalms have many references to Jesus.\nThe following scriptures are selected from among the Messianic Psalms ful-\nfilled by Jesus:\na) Psalm 110:1 \u201cThe LORD said to my Lord, \u2018Sit at My right hand,\nTill I make Your enemies Your footstool.\u2019\u201d Jesus applied this to Himself\nin Mark 12:35-37.\nb) Psalm 2:7 \u201c\u2026The LORD has said to Me, \u2018You are My Son, Today\nI have begotten You\u2026\u2019\u201d Paul applied this passage to Jesus in Acts 13:33.\nc) Psalm 45:6 \u201cYour throne, O God, is forever and ever\u2026\u201d The\nwriter of Hebrews ascribed this to Jesus in Hebrews 1:8.\n5. Jesus, the Promised Messiah: Isaiah prophesied that Messiah would be\nborn of a virgin (Isa. 7:14). Isaiah 9:6-7 depicted Jesus as the Prince of Peace,\nthe Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, Son of David. Micah prophesied\nthat Jesus would be born in Bethlehem (Mic. 5:2). Isaiah 53 referred to Jesus\nas a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, bruised for our iniquities.\nJesus is the only reasonable identification for this Servant of Yahweh. Further,\nPhilip the evangelist applied Isaiah 53 to Jesus. Several addressed Jesus as\nthe \u201cSon of David\u201d (Matt. 9:27; 21:9). After His resurrection, Jesus Himself\nattested to the fact that He is the Messiah referred to in the Old Testament\nScriptures (Luke 24:27).\n\nB. The concept of the Trinity in the New Testament\nAfter the resurrection of Jesus and the descent of the Holy Spirit on the\nDay of Pentecost, the doctrine of the Trinity was crystal clear to the New\nTestament church. When the apostles began to preach the gospel and write\nepistles, they did not waver in declaring Jesus as God and the Holy Spirit as\nGod. Yet they also viewed the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit as one God\n(1 Cor. 8:6). The following are proofs of the Trinity in the New Testament:\n1. The baptism of Jesus: The three persons of the Godhead were present\nat the baptism of Jesus. Jesus ascended from the waters of baptism, the Holy\nSpirit descended from heaven in the visible form of a dove, and the Father\nspoke from heaven (Matt. 3:17; see also Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22; John\n1:32-34). All three manifested at the same time. The Father spoke of the Son\nas a separate identity, and the Spirit was present as an identity separate from\nthe Son and the Father.\n2. The proclamations of Jesus: John 14 provides clear proof of the three\ndistinct persons of the Trinity. First, in John 14:9, Jesus said to Philip, \u201cHe\nwho has seen Me has seen the Father.\u201d In this proclamation it is clear that\nJesus and the Father are one yet have separate identities. Jesus said to the dis-\nciples, \u201cAnd I will pray to the Father, and He will give you another Helper,\nthat He may abide with you forever\u2026But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom\nthe Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring\nto your remembrance all things that I said to you\u201d (John 14:16, 26). Jesus\nspoke of the Father as \u201cHe,\u201d of the Holy Spirit as \u201cHe,\u201d and of Himself as\n\u201cI.\u201d Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as \u201canother Helper,\u201d separate in identity.\nThe Spirit would come when Jesus went away. Yet Jesus also said, \u201c\u2026And lo,\nI am with you always, even to the end of the age\u2026\u201d (Matt. 28:20). Herein is\nthe mystery: There are three separate identities (not individuals), yet there is\none God, not three.\n3. The Great Commission: The baptismal formula given by Jesus in the\nGreat Commission clearly reveals the Trinity as well as the oneness of God:\n\u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matt. 28:19). The\n\nthree identities are given as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, grouped together in\nequality. The word \u201cname\u201d is not repeated, indicating the unity.\n4. Early church benedictions: The apostolic benediction in 2 Corinthians\n13:14 clearly shows the trinitarian thinking of the early church. A similar\ntrinitarian statement appears in Jude 20:21, \u201cBut you, beloved, building\nyourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep your-\nselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto\neternal life.\u201d In these two benedictions, Jesus is placed first in one, and the\nHoly Spirit is first in the other. This indicates that the Son and Holy Spirit\nare not inferior but, indeed, equal to the Father and to each other. Other\nexamples include: 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; Ephesians 4:4-6; 5:18-20, and 2\nThessalonians 2:13-14.\nVIII. God the Father\nThe general doctrine of God has already been addressed under the sec-\ntions on the existence, nature, names and attributes of God. However, to\nunderstand God\u2019s triunity it is important to look at the concept of God as\nFather of our Lord Jesus Christ. The relationship of the Father and the Son is\nan issue of God\u2019s self-revelation in the context of redemption. God\u2019s father-\nhood does not mean that the Father existed alone and then begot the Son.\nAll the persons of the Trinity are coeternal and coequal. Lexicons define the\nGreek word monogenes (often translated as \u201conly begotten\u201d in reference to\nJesus) to mean \u201cof the same kind.\u201d John spoke of Jesus as the Word: \u201cIn the\nbeginning was the Word, and the Word was with God [lit. face to face with],\nand the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God [lit. already was]\u201d\n(John 1:1-2). John continued by writing, \u201cAnd the Word (Christ preincar-\nnate) became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory\nas of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth\u201d (John 1:14).\nAlthough the Word became flesh at a certain time in history, the Word has\nalways been a coequal, coeternal member of the Trinity. Jesus also identified\nHimself as one with the Father when he prayed, \u201cAnd now, O Father, glorify\nMe together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the\nworld was\u201d (John 17:5). Before the universe was created, our triune God\n\nexisted in perfect, eternal, loving community. The Father, Son and Holy\nSpirit have always been and always will be one in nature, will and purpose.\nIX. God the Son\nA. His virgin birth\nJesus\u2019 conception was miraculous. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit\nand born of the virgin Mary. Angelic announcements to Joseph and Mary\npreceded His birth (Matt. 1:20b-25; see also Luke 1:26-38).\n1. Theological implications of the virgin birth: The entirety of the\nChristian faith is dependent upon Jesus having been born of God. If Jesus\u2019\nfather had been human, the following would have been true:\na) He would have inherited Adam\u2019s fallen nature, and His death\nwould not have been vicarious or substitutionary.\nb) He would not have been infinite, and even if some method could\nhave been arranged to avoid a corporate identity with Adam, He could\nnot have died for the world. He would have been merely a sincere, zeal-\nous but finite religious leader.\nc) He could not have been the \u201conly begotten\u201d of the Father, the\nunique, infinite Son of God. The denial of the virgin birth is a virtual\ndenial of the deity of Christ.\nd) He would have been, at best, a spiritual genius with unusual reli-\ngious insight, not the Lamb of God who fulfilled and satisfied all require-\nments of the Law and the Old Testament sacrificial system. Only a divine\nand infinite offering could make an effective, all-encompassing, once-for-\nall sacrifice for sin. Christ\u2019s sacrifice had the authority to free all creation,\nfor He is the creator of all things (Col. 1:15-18).\n\n2. New Testament support for the virgin birth: In Matthew 1:16, the\nconclusion of Joseph\u2019s genealogy states that Jesus was born of Mary: \u201cAnd\nJacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is\ncalled Christ.\u201d The \u201cby whom\u201d in the Greek (ex hes) is singular, feminine\ngender, making the birth to be \u201cby Mary\u201d only even though the genealogy is\nJoseph\u2019s. Paul stated that Jesus was \u201cborn of a woman\u201d (Gal. 4:4). That ter-\nminology, in conjunction with the other genealogical references, undeniably\nindicates Christ\u2019s virgin birth.\n3. Old Testament prophecies regarding the virgin birth: Progressive rev-\nelation in the Old Testament points toward the supernatural virgin birth of\nJesus. Various New Testament scriptures confirm that the Old Testament\nprophecies listed below were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 birth.\na) Genesis 3:15 prophesied about the woman\u2019s Seed: \u201cAnd I will put\nenmity between you and the woman, And between your seed and her\nSeed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.\u201d\nFulfillment: Matthew 1:16 states that Jesus was born \u201cof Mary\u201d;\nGalatians 4:4 states that He was \u201cborn of a woman.\u201d\nb) Genesis 22:18 prophesied of the seed that will bless the entire\nearth: \u201cIn your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because\nyou have obeyed My voice.\u201d\nFulfillment: \u201cNow to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made.\nHe does not say, \u2018And to seeds,\u2019 as of many, but as of one, \u2018And to your\nSeed,\u2019 who is Christ\u201d (Gal. 3:16).\nc) Isaiah 11:1-2 prophesied of the rod and branch of Jesse: \u201cThere\nshall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow\nout of his roots. The Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him, The Spirit\nof wisdom and understanding, The Spirit of counsel and might, The\nSpirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.\u201d\n\nFulfillment: Matthew begins his gospel with the words, \u201cThe book\nof the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David\u2026\u201d (Matt. 1:1).\nd) Isaiah 7:14 prophesied of the virgin birth of Immanuel: \u201cTherefore\nthe Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive\nand bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.\u201d\nFulfillment: An angelic announcement preceded the birth of Jesus.\nMary was told that she would bring forth a child who would be the Son\nof the Highest, and in spite of her not \u201cknowing\u201d a man (Luke 1:34), it\nwould happen by the Holy Spirit\u2019s \u201covershadowing\u201d (Luke 1:35).\n4. Orthodox creeds concerning the virgin birth: The Westminster\nCatechism defines the doctrine of the virgin birth as follows: \u201cChrist the Son\nof God, became man, by taking to himself a true body and a reasonable soul,\nbeing conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin\nMary, and born of her yet without sin.\u201d12 The Apostles\u2019 Creed, which sums\nup the belief of the early church, states this of Jesus: \u201cconceived by the Holy\nGhost, born of the Virgin Mary.\u201d13\nB. His nature\nJesus had a divine nature and a human nature, yet He was one person,\nnot two. He was the \u201cSon of God\u201d and the \u201cSon of Man.\u201d However, Jesus\u2019\ntwo natures did not result in a dual personality. Rather, God and flesh-and-\nblood existed in perfect harmony in Jesus Christ (1 Tim. 2:5). Jesus existed\nin the form of God and was equal with God, but He took upon Himself the\nform of a servant and was made in the likeness of humanity. The Greek homo-\nioma means \u201creal likeness,\u201d but His likeness was not merely human. Jesus was\na real man, but He was not merely a human. Jesus was born in the flesh, lived\na physical life and died a physical death. Even so, He was also the Ancient of\nDays (John 8:58).\n12 The Westminster Larger Catechism, accessed at http://www.opc.org/lchtml (January 17, 2008).\n13 \u201cThe Apostles\u2019 Creed,\u201d accessed at http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.htme?mainframe+http://\nreformed.org/documents/apostles_creed.html (January 17, 2008).\n\n1. The humanity of Jesus: John warned against a heresy that denied the\nhumanity of Jesus (1 John 4:1-3). Some believers have been so intent on\nmaintaining the deity of Christ Jesus that they have minimized His humanity.\nJesus did not merely have a brush with humanity; He took to Himself a gen-\nuine human nature with every human attribute except sinfulness. His human\nnature was in submission to His divine nature without sacrificing any of its\nhumanness. The following is evidence of His humanity:\na) Jesus was born a natural infant in Bethlehem (Luke 2:7).\nb) He grew up in the normal manner of a child (Luke 2:39-40).\nc) He grew up in subjection to His parents (Luke 2:51-52).\nd) He was traced through two genealogies: one of Joseph (Matt. l),\nand one of Mary (Luke 3:23-38).\ne) Scripture refers to Him as \u201cThe Seed of Woman,\u201d \u201cThe Seed of\nAbraham\u201d and \u201cThe Son of David.\u201d These references link Jesus to the\nhuman race.\nf) Jesus was tempted and tested at every point of human weakness,\nyet He remained without sin. It was perfectly in order for Him to be\ntested to demonstrate, as the \u201cLast Adam,\u201d His perfect obedience, and as\nthe Lamb of God that He was \u201cwithout spot or blemish\u201d (Matt. 4:1-11;\n26:36-46; Luke 4:1-13; Heb. 2:18; 4:15).\ng) He called Himself a \u201cman\u201d (John 8:40); others called Him a man:\n\u201cFor there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man\nChrist Jesus\u201d (1 Tim. 2:5). He called Himself or was called the \u201cSon of\nMan\u201d 70 times throughout Scripture, e.g., John 8:28.\nh) The Bible declares that Jesus is the believer\u2019s High Priest (Heb.\n4:14-16). The Old Testament stated that priests were to be chosen from\namong the people to be their representative. To be the High Priest of all\n\nbelievers, Jesus had to share the believer\u2019s state (Heb. 5:1-10). The true\nHigh Priest must also be able to approach the throne of God on his own\nmerit. Jesus the Son of God represents God to people, and conversely\npeople to God. The believer\u2019s High Priest is the Godman, \u201c\u2026having\nbecome High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek\u201d (Heb.\n6:20).\ni) Jesus experienced human feelings and sensations; He experienced\nhunger, thirst, tears and fatigue. He suffered, shed His blood, died and\nwas buried.\nj) Even after the resurrection, when Jesus had a glorified body, Jesus\ninvited Thomas to touch His hands and side to feel His wounds. Jesus\nretained His humanity along with His divinity. According to Revelation\n19:11-16, Jesus will return to reign on earth. In Revelation 22, Jesus is\ndescribed as being with the Father in the New Jerusalem.\n2. The divinity of Jesus: Human reasoning alone cannot fully compre-\nhend the dual nature of Jesus. However, when faith is added, it is possible to\naccept the Scripture-revealed mystery that Jesus was both human and divine.\nThe following is evidence of Jesus\u2019 divinity:\na) Old Testament prophets foretold of a Redeemer and gave Him\ndivine names:\n(1) Isaiah called him \u201cWonderful, Counselor, Mighty God,\nEverlasting Father, Prince of Peace\u201d (Isa. 9:6) and \u201cImmanuel,\u201d or God\nwith us (Isa. 7:14).\n(2) Jeremiah referred to him as \u201cThe LorD our righTeousness\n[Yahweh Tsidkenu]\u201d (Jer. 23:6).\nb) He is called God and Lord in the New Testament (John 1:1;\n20:28; Tit. 2:13; Heb. 1:8).\n\nc) He is called the unique Son of God (John 1:14; 3:16). The term\n\u201conly begotten\u201d (Gr., monogenes) means \u201cunique, of the very same kind.\u201d\nA host of scriptures refer to Jesus as the \u201cSon of God\u201d (John 5:25; Rom.\n8:3; 1 John 2:22-23).\nd) Jesus declared himself to be one with the Father (John 10:30;\n14:9).\ne) Scripture teaches Jesus is preexistent (John 1:1; 8:58; 17:5).\nf) Divine attributes were ascribed to Jesus:\n(1) He is omnipotent (Matt. 28:18, TMB).\n(2) He is omniscient (John 2:24-25; 16:30; Col. 2:1-3).\n(3) He is omnipresent (Matt. 28:20).\n(4) He is eternal (John 1:1-2; Col. 1:17; Heb. 7:24).\n(5) He is immutable (Heb. 13:8).\n(6) He is creator (John 1:10; Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:10).\n(7) He is holy (Heb. 7:26; 1 John 3:5).\n(8) He is forgiver (Mark 2:5; Luke 7:48).\n(9) He is judge (John 5:22; Acts 17:31; 2 Cor. 5:10).\ng) Jesus was aware of and declared His unique relationship as the Son\nof God to the Father and to the Holy Spirit (John 15:26).\n\nh) Worship was directed toward Jesus. Worship belongs only unto\nGod Almighty (Exod. 20:3-5). Yet, Christ received worship without\nobjection or protest (Matt. 14:33). At Jesus\u2019 birth, the wise men paid\nhomage unto Him (Matt. 2:11). Angels were commanded to worship\nHim (Heb. 1:6). Jesus is God, the second person of the Trinity, coequal\nand coeternal with the Father. Therefore, Jesus is and forever will be wor-\nshiped as God.\nSome individuals and movements have denied the deity of Christ. Jesus\u2019\ndeity was denied by the Ebionites (A.D. 107) and then later by Arias and\nhis followers (325 A.D.). Christ\u2019s deity has also been questioned by liberal\ntheologians as well as Deists, Unitarians, Christian Scientists, Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses and Mormons. Some who have professed belief in Christ\u2019s deity\nactually believe in a created Christ who was above men but less than God, or\nthey believe that Jesus was \u201cdivine\u201d in the sense that all men may be divine.\nRegardless, the mainstream of the church has always held to the doctrines of\nthe Trinity and the deity of Christ.\nC. His works\nJesus was a worker. He said, \u201cMy Father has been working until now,\nand I have been working\u201d (John 5:17). He stated to the disciples, \u201cMy food\nis to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work\u201d (John 4:34).\nNear the end of His earthly ministry, Jesus proclaimed to the Father, \u201cI have\nfinished the work which You have given Me to do\u201d (John 17:4). Any study\nof the Christian faith must interpret the meaning of Christ\u2019s work on earth.\nGod Himself, in the person of the Son, visited the world to redeem out of\nthe world a people for His own possession. To understand the foundations of\nsalvation and all Christian life, it is crucial to study the saving work of Christ.\nMany theologians have categorized Jesus\u2019 work into three general areas: (1)\nHis work as a prophet, (2) His work as a priest and (3) His work as a king.\nThere were three types of Old Testament leaders, commissioned by God, who\nwere ushered into their offices by the symbolic act of being anointed with oil.\nThis act signified the fullness of the Holy Spirit. While ministering on earth,\nJesus was called both the \u201cMessiah\u201d and the \u201cChrist,\u201d terms meaning \u201cthe\n\nanointed one.\u201d Christ, God\u2019s Anointed, fulfilled all three ministries as the\nultimate prophet, priest and king.\n1. Jesus the prophet: A prophet is commissioned by God with the pri-\nmary task of making God\u2019s will and character known to His people. Often\nprophets will proclaim God\u2019s will by foretelling future events. Moses was the\ngreatest Old Testament prophet, having proclaimed to the Israelites the will of\nGod in the form of the Law. Moses also spoke on behalf of God when he fore-\ntold the coming of the greatest of all prophets (Deut.18:18). Centuries later,\nwhen Jesus addressed the synagogue at Nazareth, He applied to Himself a\nMessianic prophecy from Isaiah 61 (Luke 4:18-21). After healing a lame man\nat the Beautiful Gate, Peter addressed the gathered crowd and declared Jesus\nwas the promised prophet who fulfilled Moses\u2019 prophecy (Acts 3:25-26). The\nauthor of Hebrews further expressed the prophetic mission of Jesus to speak\nGod\u2019s will to the people (Heb. 1:1-2). Five functions usually characterize the\nministry of a prophet: (1) preaching, (2) teaching, (3) discipling, (4) predict-\ning and (5) performing miracles. Not every prophet\u2019s ministry included all\nfive functions, yet the lives of several Old Testament prophets, e.g., Elijah,\nIsaiah and Jeremiah, included a full range of these functions. Most certainly\nthe prophetic ministry of Jesus manifested all of them.\na) Preaching: Jesus began His prophetic ministry with preaching\n(Mark 1:14). Approximately 50 of the discourses of Jesus are recorded\nin the New Testament. The best known of these messages is called\nthe \u201cSermon on the Mount\u201d (Matt. 5-7). The preaching of Jesus was\nrevolutionary. He called people to change their ways (Mark 1:15). To\nNicodemus, Jesus firmly stated that people must be born again (John\n3:3). Yet Jesus did not preach as a doomsday prophet; He always held\nout hopeful assurance for those who would respond and repent (Luke\n19:10). Jesus did not merely declare the word of God; He was the Word\nof God incarnate.\nb) Teaching: In ancient times the title of \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201cteacher\u201d con-\nveyed great honor. The Bible states that people were astonished with\nJesus\u2019 teaching (Mark 1:21-22; John 7:40, 46). Jesus\u2019 parables amazed\nthe most astute and learned of the day, yet His teaching even attracted\n\nthe children. The parable of \u201cThe Good Samaritan\u201d still resounds\ntoday as perhaps one of the best known stories in the Western world.\nConsidering the profound impact that Jesus\u2019 life and words have had on\npeople throughout the centuries, we can confidently assert that Jesus is\nthe greatest of all teachers. He did not merely quote authorities; He is the\nAuthority. He did not merely show the way; He is the Way. He did more\nthan teach truth; He is Truth forevermore.\nc) Discipling: Closely connected with Jesus\u2019 ministry of teaching\nwas that of making disciples. Some of Jesus\u2019 disciples became the apos-\ntles of the church and were the first to preach the message of Jesus\nas the crucified and risen Savior. The gospel of Mark records Jesus\u2019\ndiscipleship call to Simon, Andrew, James and John (Mark. 1:16-20).\nLater, Jesus appointed twelve that He would disciple and send out to\nspread the good news (Mark 3:14-15). These passages describe three\npurposes for making disciples: (1) that they might be with Jesus, (2)\nthat they might preach and (3) that they might heal the sick and cast\nout demons. If these are in the order of priority, the first matter of\nimportance was that of Jesus\u2019 followers spending time in His presence.\nDisciples did not merely learn the content of books and lectures; rather,\nthey matured by being in the presence of their teacher, following His\nexample and emulating His character. Later, when Jesus gave His disci-\nples the Great Commission to go and make disciples of all nations, they\nunderstood the term \u201cmaking disciples\u201d because they had experienced\ndiscipleship firsthand. Believers are to make disciples for Christ in the\nsame manner Jesus did. Jesus taught His followers how to preach the\ngospel of the Kingdom, not in words only, but also by the power of His\ndeliverance. Finally, He gave His disciples power to heal the sick and to\ncast out demons (Mark 16:17-18).\nd) Predicting: Another important function of a prophet is foretelling\nfuture events. If a prophet\u2019s prediction came to pass and glorified God,\nthen that prophet was authenticated as one sent from God. While Jesus\ndevoted the majority of His ministry to preaching and teaching, He also\npredicted a number of future events:\n\n(1) His own death and resurrection (Matt. 16:21)\n(2) The persecution of the church (Luke 12:11)\n(3) The coming of another Helper, the Holy Spirit, to abide in the\nchurch (John 14:16-17; 16:7-11)\n(4) The destruction of the temple and the city of Jerusalem in A.D.\n70 (Luke 19:43-44; 21:6)\n(5) The signs and conditions of the last days (Matt. 24; Mark 13;\nLuke 21)\n(6) The church\u2019s triumph (Matt. 16:18)\ne) Miracles: A frequent mark of Old Testament prophets was that\nthe supernatural attended their ministry. Moses\u2019 miraculous deeds ranged\nfrom the plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea to bringing\nwater from the rock. Elijah called down fire from heaven, multiplied the\nwidow\u2019s meal and oil, raised her son from the dead and was caught up\nto heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha brought healing to Naaman the leper,\nraised up the Shunammite\u2019s son and performed numerous other miracles.\nIsaiah brought healing to King Hezekiah. Daniel stopped the mouths\nof lions and interpreted dreams. The miraculous also characterized the\nministry of Jesus. Yet He was not simply a worker of miracles; He was\nthe fountainhead of the supernatural. Jesus\u2019 birth was a miracle, and His\nresurrection from the dead was the miracle of all miracles. During His\nlife on earth, He demonstrated His deity by such wonders as walking\non water, calming the storm, turning water into wine and multiplying\nthe bread and fish. However, by far the greater number of Jesus\u2019 signs\nand wonders were miracles of compassion upon the sick, afflicted and\ndemon-possessed. Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil, thus\nimparting to the church the power to carry on the ministry of deliver-\nance. Jesus gave assurance of the continuance of miracles in the Great\nCommission (Mark 16:15-18).\n\n2. Jesus the great High Priest: While a prophet represented God to\nhumanity, a priest represented humanity to God. Three things characterized\nthe work of a priest: (1) he was chosen from among those he represented to\nGod (Exod. 28:1), (2) he offered sacrifices to God to atone for sin (Lev. 4:13-\n21), and (3) as a mediator, he made intercession for the people (Isa. 53:12; 1\nTim. 2:5). Jesus met all of these qualifications (Heb. 5:1-5; 10:11-12) and has\nassumed the priestly role on behalf of believers (Heb. 7:24-26).\na) Jesus emptied Himself to become human. He did not hold onto\nthe prerogatives of deity but took upon Himself the form of a servant\nwho was made in the likeness of humanity to identify fully with those\nfor whom He would make atonement (Phil. 2:5-8). Jesus is qualified\nto stand before God the Father on behalf of believers because He made\nhimself one with humanity: \u201cTherefore, in all things He had to be made\nlike His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in\nthings pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.\nFor in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid\nthose who are tempted\u201d (Heb. 2:17-18).\nb) Jesus is both priest and sacrifice. Timothy stated of Jesus\u2019 priestly\nrole that \u201c\u2026there is one God and one Mediator between God and men,\nthe Man Christ Jesus\u201d (1 Tim. 2:5). John the Baptist introduced Jesus as\n\u201cthe Lamb of God,\u201d speaking of His sacrifice for man\u2019s sin (John 1:29).\nPeter also spoke of Jesus as \u201ca lamb without blemish and without spot\u201d (1\nPet. 1:19). In the final human drama described in the book of Revelation,\nthe One who sits on heaven\u2019s throne\u2014God Almighty\u2014searches for one\nworthy to receive the title deed to the Kingdom. No one is found but one\ncalled \u201cthe Lion of the Tribe of Judah\u201d and \u201cthe Root of David.\u201d\nWhen He approaches the throne to take the document, this victo-\nrious One is pictured as a slain lamb. All of heaven and the church then\nsing a new song declaring the worthiness of the Lamb (Rev. 5:9). Jesus\nChrist is both the \u201cLion of the Tribe of Judah\u201d and the \u201cLamb who was\nslain.\u201d He is the priest who mediates between God and humanity as well\nas the sacrifice who takes away the sin of the world.\n\nc) Jesus makes atonement and intercession for believers. Jesus not\nonly died to make atonement for sin, but also perpetually intercedes for\nbelievers before the Father (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 10:12). Jesus saves from the\nguilt of sin all who place their faith in Him. He also intercedes contin-\nuously for those who believe in Him, saving them from the power and\npresence of sin (Heb. 7:24-25). Jesus is the great High Priest. Having fully\nidentified with human frailties, He now represents believers to the Father\nso they may have access to the throne of grace. He is also the perfect sac-\nrifice for sin. Through the blood and sacrifice of Jesus, believers receive\natonement. Finally, He is the interceding advocate for every believer.\nd) Jesus\u2019 priesthood is likened to that of Melchizedek. Little is known\nof Melchizedek; Genesis 14:18-20 contains the historic account of this\npriest in three short verses. The psalmist referred to Melchizedek in Psalm\n110:4, a Messianic psalm. Peter applied this psalm to Jesus (Acts 2:34-\n35) as did the writer of Hebrews (1:13). Melchizedek was an earthly king\nof Salem, but he had been appointed to the priesthood of the Most High\nGod by direct revelation. In other words, his office was not dependent\nupon a priestly dynasty. Even though he was human, his priesthood was\ndivine and endless in nature. Since the priesthood of Levi (and Aaron)\nwas not able to offer sacrifices that could take away sin (Heb. 10:4), a\nhigh priest of a perpetual order needed to come who could destroy Satan\u2019s\nkingdom. The Levitical priesthood was under the old covenant that was\ndestined to come to an end (Heb. 7:18). The priesthood of Jesus is under\nthe new covenant of grace and is eternal (Heb. 7:24-25).\nHebrews 7 compares the priesthood of Jesus to that of Melchizedek.\nFirst, Melchizedek was more than a priest; he was also a king. In fact,\nby both name and title, Melchizedek held a royal distinction. His\nname means \u201cKing of Righteousness,\u201d and his title as King of Salem\n(Jerusalem) means \u201cKing of Peace.\u201d Jesus holds this same royal distinc-\ntion. As the \u201cKing of Righteousness\u201d (Isa. 32:1) and \u201cPrince of Peace\u201d\n(Isa. 9:6), Jesus embodies the very essence of the traits represented by\nMelchizedek\u2019s priesthood. Though Jesus fulfilled a number of aspects of\nthe Levitical priesthood (e.g., entering within the veil), Levi was not a\nsufficient type for His priesthood. Priests were those from the tribe of\n\nLevi, and Jesus\u2019 earthly lineage was of Judah (Heb. 7:14). Melchizedek,\nhowever, represented a priesthood that was superior to the Levitical for\nthe following reasons:\n(1) Abraham, the great-grandfather of Levi, paid tithes to\nMelchizedek, his superior (Heb. 7:4).\n(2) Abraham was blessed by Melchizedek; \u201cthe lesser is blessed by the\ngreater\u201d (Heb. 7:6-7).\n(3) Levitical priests must be able to trace their genealogy; no par-\nentage or genealogy is recorded for Melchizedek although the book of\nGenesis is full of genealogies (Heb. 7:3).\n(4) The deaths of Levi, Aaron and Eleazar are recorded. No men-\ntion is made of the birth or death of Melchizedek; his priesthood was\nby direct divine appointment and not dependent upon tribal status or\nparentage. Therefore, in type, the priesthood of Melchizedek is perpetual\n(Heb. 7:15-17).\n(5) The priestly work of the Levitical priesthood had virtue only\nbecause, in the \u201cfullness of time,\u201d the perfect priest would come and\noffer the perfect sacrifice (Heb. 10:1-12).\n(6) The perfect priest, prophesied by the psalmist in Psalm 110:2,\nwould be a royal priest.\n3. Jesus the king: Christ\u2019s work has been presented in this study under the\ncategories of (1) prophet, (2) priest and (3) king. As prophet, He is the mes-\nsage-bearer. As priest, He is the sin-bearer. As king, He is the scepter-bearer.\nMoses prophesied His coming as a prophet; Isaiah prophesied His coming\nas the priest, and Daniel prophesied His coming as Messiah and King. The\nangel announced the birth of Jesus to Mary as a royal proclamation (Luke\n1:31-33). Christ\u2019s kingly work will be examined under three headings:\n\na) Jesus\u2019 kingly mission: Even at His birth, there was awareness that\nJesus was a king. Herod asked the Magi to tell him the location of the\nbaby who had been born \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d (Matt. 2:2). Jesus Himself\nwas aware of His royal mission as announced by John the Baptist (Matt.\n3:1-2). In Mark 11:1-11, Jesus presented Himself to Jerusalem as their\nking as prophesied in Zechariah 9:9. When Pilate asked Him if He were\na king, Jesus answered affirmatively but added that His kingdom is not\nof this world (John 18:36). The cross on which Jesus died bore the title,\n\u201cJesus of nAzAreTh, The King of The Jews\u201d (John 19:19). After the\nresurrection, during the forty days on earth before the ascension, Jesus\u2019\ncentral focus was His kingdom (Acts 1:3).\nb) Jesus\u2019 kingdom: Christ represented His kingdom as both present\nand future (Mark 1:14-15). Some scholars insist that the kingdom of\nGod is entirely future, an eschatological kingdom. Such a conclusion\nis not plausible when two key factors are considered. First, the Greek\nword for \u201ckingdom\u201d (basileia) does not refer to the sphere over which\nChrist rules but to the rule itself. Wherever Christ Jesus is sovereign,\nthere is His rule (kingdom). Wherever Christ is Lord, there His king-\ndom is present. Second, when people place their faith in Christ, they\nare delivered from Satan\u2019s kingdom into Christ\u2019s kingdom (Col. 1:13).\nDuring Jesus\u2019 earthly ministry which culminated in the crucifixion\nand resurrection, He overturned the kingdom of Satan (Luke 11:20).\nFurther, in connection to the founding of the church, Jesus said to\nthe disciples, \u201cAnd I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,\nand whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what-\never you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\u201d (Matt.16:19). George\nEldon Ladd had the following to say about the present manifestation\nof Christ\u2019s kingdom:\nMen may now experience the reality of the reign of\nGod\u2026The presence of Christ on earth had for its pur-\npose the defeat of Satan, his binding, so that God\u2019s\npower may be a vital reality in the experience of those\nwho yield to God\u2019s reign by becoming the disciples of\n\nJesus. In Christ, the kingdom in the form of its power\nhas come among men.14\nc) Jesus\u2019 kingly return: As the culmination of Christ\u2019s work on earth,\nHe will come again to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Rev.\n19:16; 20:6). Jesus fulfilled the prophecies of the coming Messiah. His\nkingdom was not a visible realm with a throne and a capitol. Rather,\nduring His earthly ministry, He defeated Satan and initiated a kingdom\nof righteousness (Col. 1:13). At the culmination of this age, Christ the\nKing will come and establish His kingdom on earth as well as in heaven,\nand all believers shall reign with Him.\nX. God the Holy Spirit\nWith regard to the Holy Spirit, the Nicene Creed states, \u201cWe believe\nin the Holy Ghost, who is the Lord and giver of life, who, proceedeth from\nthe Father, who with the Father and Son, is worshiped and glorified, who\nspake by the prophets.\u201d15 Sound doctrine depends upon a clear and accurate\nunderstanding of the nature and work of the third person of the Trinity who\ndwells in and empowers the church. The last discourse of Jesus recorded in\nthe gospel of John clearly demonstrates that the Holy Spirit has a separate\nidentity from the Father and the Son. Jesus referred several times to the com-\ning of the Holy Spirit, whom He called \u201canother Helper\u201d (John 14:16). He\nused masculine personal pronouns to express the Spirit\u2019s distinct personhood.\nJesus said that He would send the Helper from the Father (John 15:26).\nThese passages demonstrate both the separate identity of the Spirit and the\ninterplay of roles among the Trinity: Jesus prays, the Father sends, and the\nHoly Spirit proceeds. The Helper\u2019s coming will be the result of the Son\u2019s\npraying and sending, the Father\u2019s sending in the Son\u2019s name and the Spirit\u2019s\nproceeding. The Holy Spirit, then, proceeds (as the creeds declare) from the\nFather and the Son.\n14 George E. Ladd, Crucial Questions About the Kingdom of God (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans\nPublishing Company, 1971) 91.\n15 Henry Bittenson, Documents of the Christian Church, 2nd edition (Oxford University Press, 1976) 26.\n\nAn ancient heresy, called Sabellianism, taught that the Father, Son and\nHoly Spirit were only different names and different modalities or manifesta-\ntions of the same person. If this were true, Jesus\u2019 discourse about the Helper\nwould be meaningless as would His prayer to the Father recorded in John 17.\nIt is difficult to determine whether the portion of John 15:26 referencing the\n\u201cproceeding\u201d of the Spirit demonstrates an eternal relationship (as stated by\nthe creeds) or a proceeding into the church on the day of Pentecost in answer\nto Jesus\u2019 prayer, for the \u201cproceeding\u201d is nowhere else mentioned. Whether the\nproceeding is eternal or on the occasion of Jesus\u2019 prayer, it is clear that the\nHoly Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son (compare John 14:26\nwith John 15:26 and John 16:7).\nA. The deity of the Holy Spirit\nThe Holy Spirit is God, the third person of the Trinity, coequal and\ncoeternal with the Father and the Son. That the Spirit executes the will of the\nFather and glorifies the Son does not denote inferiority; it merely indicates\nthe inner working of the Triune God. Among some people, subordination\ncan denote inferiority, but this is not the case with God. Such is a part of the\nincomprehensible mystery of the Trinity\u2014there are not three individuals in\nthe Trinity but three personal identities in the one God. The following are\nscriptural proofs of the deity of the Holy Spirit:\n1. The Holy Spirit is called God: The book of Acts contains a sobering\naccount of two members of the early church, Ananias and Sapphira, acting\ndeceitfully and being stricken by God for their duplicity. A portion of the\naccount makes it clear that sin against the Holy Spirit is sin against God (Acts\n5:3-4). It is important to note that Ananias and Sapphira\u2019s fatal sin was not\nan issue of money but an issue of deceit.\n2. Divine attributes are ascribed to the Holy Spirit:\na) The Holy Spirit is eternal: He is not a created being. He always\nexisted as a part of the triune God; He is coeternal with the Father and\nthe Son (Heb. 9:14).\n\nb) The Holy Spirit is omniscient: He knows all things (John 14:26).\nc) The Holy Spirit is omnipresent: He is everywhere present (Ps.\n139:7).\nd) The Holy Spirit is omnipotent: He is all-powerful (Acts 1:8;\n10:38; Rom. 15:19).\ne) The Holy Spirit is holy: As His name indicates, the Holy Spirit\nis holy. He is the Spirit of Holiness and is Himself holy as are the Father\nand the Son (Rom. 1:1-4).\nf) The Holy Spirit is foreknowing: He knows the future (Acts 1:15-\n16). A thousand years before the birth of Christ, the Holy Spirit, through\nthe psalmist, foretold the betrayal and fate of Judas Iscariot (Ps. 109:8).\nSee also Acts 11:27-28 concerning the prediction by the Spirit, through\nAgabus, of the great famine.\ng) The Holy Spirit is love: He is loving in nature (Rom. 15:30). In\nthe Trinitarian benediction of 2 Corinthians 13:14, the grace of Christ\nand the communion of the Holy Spirit are actually aspects of God\u2019s\nlove. Since God is love, we expect to find love manifested in the acts of\nthe Trinity.\n3. Divine works are attributed to the Holy Spirit:\na) Creation: The Holy Spirit is active in creation (Gen. 1:2; Ps.\n104:30). The life-giving work of the Holy Spirit was displayed in the\novershadowing of Mary at the conception of Jesus (Luke 1:35) and in the\nraising of Jesus from the dead (Rom. 8:10-11). Additionally, the internal\nspiritual regeneration that occurs when a new believer is \u201cborn again\u201d is\nevidence of the Spirit\u2019s power (John 3:5-8).\n\nb) Inspiration of Scripture: The Holy Spirit is credited for inspiring\nthe Word of God (2 Pet. 1:21). Paul affirmed this concept to Timothy (2\nTim. 3:16). \u201cInspiration of God\u201d is literally \u201cGod-breathed.\u201d\nc) Prophecy: The Holy Spirit gives prophetic words (2 Sam. 23:2-\n3). The Holy Spirit is equated with the \u201cGod of Israel\u201d and the \u201cRock of\nIsrael\u201d in this passage. The Spirit is the Spirit of Yahweh who is the same\nas Eloah (God of creation) and the Rock (Tsur, a metaphorical name for\nthe \u201cEternal, Immutable One\u201d).\nd) Empowerment of believers: The indwelling Holy Spirit provides\neach believer with the power to \u201cput to death the deeds of the flesh\u201d and\nthereby overcome and resist sin (Rom. 8:2-4, 11-14; Gal. 5:16-24).\ne) Intercession: The Holy Spirit prays on behalf of believers (Rom.\n8:26-27). The omniscient Holy Spirit knows the mind of God and the\nwill of God for each person; therefore, He is able to direct us in prayer so\nthat we can pray in accordance with His perfect plan.\nf) Divine guidance: The Spirit instructs and guides believers so that\nthey may act in accordance to God\u2019s will (Mark 13:11).\nB. The personhood of the Holy Spirit\nAs early as apostolic times, false teachers doubted or denied the person-\nhood of the Holy Spirit. Some pictured the Spirit as a force or influence\nexerted by God rather than a person. This tendency may derive in part from\nthe word \u201cspirit\u201d from the Latin spiritus, which means \u201cbreath.\u201d The Greek\nword pneuma and the Hebrew word ruach both have the same meaning of\n\u201cbreath\u201d or \u201cwind\u201d as well as \u201cspirit.\u201d If we think of the Holy Spirit as merely\nthe \u201cbreath\u201d of God, then it is possible to perceive Him as an impersonal\nforce rather than a distinct being having a separate identity from the Father.\nHowever, divine revelation is specific in its explanation that God is spirit (not\nmaterial or physical). Like the wind, God exerts power and force while being\n\ninvisible by nature. Observe the following proofs from Scripture (of which\nthere are many) of the personhood of the Holy Spirit as well as His separate\nidentity from the Father:\n1. Personal pronouns are used in relation to the Holy Spirit: In spite of\nthe fact that the Greek word for \u201cspirit\u201d is in neuter gender, the demonstra-\ntive pronoun ekeinos, \u201cthat One,\u201d was used in John 16:13-14 to refer to the\nHoly Spirit. Paul used a masculine relative pronoun to refer to the Spirit in\nEphesians 1:13-14.\n2. Personal characteristics are ascribed to the Holy Spirit:\na) Intelligence: The Holy Spirit is one who reveals the things of God\n(1 Cor. 2:10-12). Furthermore, \u201cthe word of wisdom\u201d and \u201cthe word of\nknowledge\u201d are gifts given by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8).\nb) Emotion and feeling: The Holy Spirit loves (Rom. 15:30) and is\ngrieved (Isa. 63:10; Eph. 4:30).\nc) A will: Gifts are distributed to people according to the will of the\nSpirit (1 Cor. 12:11).\n3. Personal actions are attributed to the Holy Spirit:\na) He speaks (Acts 13:2; 21:11; Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29).\nb) He testifies (John 15:26).\nc) He teaches (John 14:26).\nd) He intercedes (Rom. 8:26-27).\n\ne) He guides (John 16:13; Acts 16:6).\nf) He gives commands and ordains (Acts 13:2; 20:28).\ng) He works miracles (Acts 8:39; Rom. 15:19).\n4. Personal reactions are ascribed to the Holy Spirit: The feelings result-\ning from certain human actions reveal the personhood of the Holy Spirit:\na) He may be tested (Acts 5:9).\nb) He may be resisted (Acts 7:51).\nc) He may be lied to (Acts 5:3).\nd) He may be insulted and blasphemed (Mark 3:29-30; Heb. 10:29).\n5. Personal relationships are maintained by the Holy Spirit:\na) With the Father: In the baptismal formula, the Spirit is associated\non an equal plane, in name and personal identity, with the Father and\nthe Son (Matt. 28:19).\nb) With Christ: The Holy Spirit is to glorify Christ and declare\ntruths that relate to Him (John 16:13-14).\nc) With believers: The apostles sought the will and good pleasure of\nthe Holy Spirit in forming the policies of the local church (Acts 15:28).\nC. Additional names of the Holy Spirit\nIt was observed earlier that God\u2019s names portray His character. The\nnames of God are not mere designations or identifications; they reveal a\n\nfacet of God\u2019s nature, attributes or works. This same concept holds true with\nthe names of the Holy Spirit. There are about 350 passages in the Scripture\nthat reference the Holy Spirit in which more than 50 names or titles are\ndiscernable. The list below, while not comprehensive, is intended to provide\nan overview of the titles that add to the understanding of the Spirit\u2019s nature\nor activity:\nThe Spirit of God (1 Cor. 3:16)\nThe Spirit (John 3:6)\nThe Spirit of the LORD, Yahweh (Isa. 11:2, ASV)\nThe Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3)\nThe Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9b)\nThe Spirit of His Son (Gal. 4:6)\nThe Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19)\nThe Spirit of holiness (Rom. 1:4)\nThe Spirit of truth (John 16:13)\nThe Spirit of glory (1 Pet. 4:14)\nThe eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14)\nThe Holy Spirit of promise (Eph. 1:13)\nThe Helper (John 16:7)\nD. Symbols of the Holy Spirit\nScripture employs a number of symbolic figures of speech to reveal\ncharacteristics of the Spirit. Studying these symbols, one develops a better\nunderstand of the ways and works of the Spirit of God.\n\nSymbols of the Holy Spirit\nSymbol Scripture Reference Explanation/Comment\nWind \u201cAnd suddenly there came a sound Wind symbolizes the invisible\nfrom heaven, as of a rushing mighty power and life-sustaining influence\nwind, and it filled the whole house of the Spirit.\nwhere they were sitting\u201d (Acts 2:2).\nOil \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is Oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit\u2019s\nupon Me, Because the LORD has anointing and empowerment of\nanointed Me [with oil]\u2026\u201d (Isa. believers for kingdom work.\n61:1a).\nDove \u201cWhen He had been baptized, Jesus The dove symbolizes gentleness,\ncame up immediately from the purity, love, innocence and beauty.\nwater; and behold, the heavens were\nopened to Him, and He saw the\nSpirit of God descending like a dove\nand alighting upon Him\u201d (Matt.\n3:16).\nWater \u201c\u2018\u2026He who believes in Me, as the Water symbolizes the Spirit\u2019s ability\nScripture has said, out of his heart to refresh and give life.\nwill flow rivers of living water.\u2019\nBut this He spoke concerning the\nSpirit\u2026\u201d (John 7:38-39).\nFire \u201cJohn answered, saying to all, \u2018I Fire speaks of the Spirit\u2019s power\nindeed baptize you with water; but and purging.\nOne mightier than I is coming,\nwhose sandal strap I am not worthy\nto loose. He will baptize you with the\nHoly Spirit and fire\u2019\u201d (Luke 3:16)."};
